The DLC has its flaws, and, I agree, is slightly overpriced. However, I still think for a ck3 fan this DLC is definitely worth it.\n\nPros: Let's start with the good side of this DLC, which is pretty attractive in my opinion. Firstly, we have the royal court itself. It costs a hella lot of money late game, but I think it's a very good addition to the game: court grandeur seems like a necessary step for getting a leg-up on rival empires late game via getting some decent passive buffs and provides a gold sink for when you're making a bit more than you really need; court positions are interesting and fairly dynamic with some decent buffs (but are a bit too expensive early game); hold court is a feature lots of people dislike due to its staleness but in my opinion adds a few good opportunities for RP and different vassal interactions, and as an extension pay homage and petition liege make playing as a vassal (personally my favourite starting condition) a bit more flavourful; finally, the courtroom itself is pretty cool and provides many opportunities for RP and some passive buffs. Artefacts are less exciting than I would have hoped but, again, provide some alright passive buffs and RP flavour. \nThere's also the other main attraction in cultures which I think is an exceedingly good revamp. Cultures feel a lot more dynamic and it forces you to consider cultures more carefully and be more careful of extending your realm into other cultures for reasons other than independence revolts. I think the diverging and hybrid cultures are pretty neat too and, again, give amazing RP opportunities.\nOverall, as someone who likes a bit of RP to spice up a run, I think Royal Court excels in making the game much more flavourful, interesting, and dynamic. \n\nCons: At the end of the day, the features are much less fleshed out than I would like them to be. The court itself feels a bit barebones when you've played for a while and tbh gets more annoying late game when you have other things to worry about than whoever your court seneschal is. Also, the claim artefact system is extremely annoying in how you often get bombarded with demands for some artefact you forgot that you even had, artefacts too are less interesting than I would have hoped. One more issue that I have is that, due to the new court system and grandeur, kingdoms and empires make much more beneficial alliances than before, which makes sense, but also sabotages the early game because kingdoms and empires at war (England and Byzantium in 1066 to be specific) instantly get incredible alliances and defeat everyone; this especially means that Harold Godwinson wins in every 1066 start, which is cool and all, but gets pretty stale.\n\nOverall: 7/10. Has its flaws for sure and needs a few tweaks but adds a lot of cool new features and is great for those who enjoy RP. Also brings a lot of potential to the modding scene (looking at you AGOT) which is always exciting since the game facilitates modding and has a very good community.", "timestamp_created": 1646677805, "timestamp_updated": 1646677805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532163739204406738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111745229": {"recommendationid": "111745229", "author": {"steamid": "76561197971285418", "num_games_owned": 189, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Got it as part of the Royal Edition.

0}, "language": "english", "review": "The whole point of the DLC, the royal court itself, is the weakest part of the DLC by far. In addition to just not being very interactive in general, it actively hurts the other actual good parts of the update, like artifacts, by making them intrinsically tied to your courtroom. Court events seem to repeat frequently (I've had a cult trying to find a lost head that's rolled into my castle multiple times on the same ruler) and it's gotten to the point that I'm not even bothering to hold court because the events are too repetitive. These events also seem to exist in an alternative universe - you will have humble, content vassals demanding that you give them something because someone else recently got something similar and now they're jealous, even though the rest of the game is great about keeping internal consistency for these kinds of things. Not only that, but there's just an utter lack of things that use the courtroom anyhow. Weddings, coronations, and other party-like events seem like they would be right at home in the court and might actually give a reason for such a thing to exist. Nope, those are all still tucked away invisibly, only seen through the occasional event.\n\nFurthermore, Paradox justified the price and delays by the fact that they had to have their team learn how to use 3D modeling tools to make the court. Beyond the fact that this is a stupid take (as a consumer, I don't care about time spent, I care about the value I get out of a product), it also seems like an overall wasted effort. You only ever look at the court when there is an event or you're putting in new artifacts. Your court is supposed to dynamically adjust who's in it based on the state your realm is in. Except, again, you never look in your court unless there is a specific reason. Even during holding court, when people take different positions to supposedly help build \"immersion\" within the event, it doesn't even feel worth it - the text alone does a far better job at allowing me to imagine the scenario in my head. I'm not sure why they felt the need to move away with ck3's basic event system where it simply shows you all characters involved with some expression on their face, as that system both gave you a quick look at who is involved in the event and just enough visualization to go along with the text without trying to do too much. In comparison, I barely know who's involved in court events because the camera is almost always hiding the faces of the actual people that are important to the event, instead showing only their backs. Once again, the major social events that actually would benefit from the court view don't take place there, despite the fact that the royal court trailer uses a wedding as an example of the purpose of the court.\n\nOn the other hand, Hybrid Cultures, Cultural Divergence, inspirations, and even the court grandeur mechanics are all pretty great additions. Hybridization and divergence finally allow for dynamic cultural outcomes from either owning large swathes of different cultural territory. Inspirations are alright, although it'd be nice if I, the ruler, could actually make something by myself, like writing my own book rather than making someone else do it for me. Finally, while the 3D royal court is extremely underwhelming for me, I do actually like the mechanical system behind it, wherein you can essentially bribe people to come live with you in return for nice things and how your court and by extension, courtiers, reflect your cultural ethos, with warlike cultures and courts naturally producing more military minded individuals.  That being said, Paradox made it clear the majority of their time and focus was on making the 3D court, which just doesn't bring very much value to the game, and in some cases, actively lowers the value of other things.\n\nIn conclusion, there's some really fun ideas that I'm sure modders will make good use of but even the good ideas can't hide the fact that the vast majority of the $30 this DLC costs is tied to a rather useless and underwhelming 3D court. In fact, while it seems like the other mechanics are well-integrated into the base game (such as grandeur affecting feasts and hunts), the courtroom itself seems to exist on its island.", "timestamp_created": 1646582405, "timestamp_updated": 1646582405, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111676790": {"recommendationid": "111676790", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054121052", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "overpriced fun mess.", "timestamp_created": 1646573673, "timestamp_updated": 1646573673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111672099": {"recommendationid": "111672099", "author": {"steamid": "76561199004047552", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Not what I expected at all disappointing and not worth it", "timestamp_created": 1646568816, "timestamp_updated": 1646568816, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.500846028327941895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111663572": {"recommendationid": "111663572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021991968", "num_games_owned": 413, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "This type of DLC whoring is extremely anticonsumer.", "timestamp_created": 1646559160, "timestamp_updated": 1646559160, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704122006893157959", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111653796": {"recommendationid": "111653796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198166113158", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "AMAZING, but alittle overpriced.

The actual court adds some much-needed personality and roleplay value to the game. It is especially fun when playing as a small realm, which makes it all the more frustrating that the court is for some reason not available to duke or count-tier rulers. Artifacts are fine, though the various interesting ways to obtain them are especially fun. The best feature of the DLC is the ability to hybridize and diverge cultures, making them much less static and allowing you to adapt your character and realm's culture to your playstyle. This is unfortunately also plagued by characteristically absurd design choices by Paradox, such as hybridization being much easier to do than diverging despite generally conferring far more advantages, and each culture having a static 'ethos' that essentializes them into a specific specialization (nothing dubious at all about the fact that most Arab and Indian cultures are 'spiritual'). \nThe pack also includes some nice new music tracks and a very few assets.\nSo while it's a good DLC, it's not nearly worth the full price (I got it automatically with Royal Edition), since it has less substance than some of the much cheaper CK2 expansions. It also makes you wonder what the development team has been doing for the past year. \nI'd say buy when 50% off, \u20ac15 seems a more reasonable price.", "timestamp_created": 1646495471, "timestamp_updated": 1646495510, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111601895": {"recommendationid": "111601895", "author": {"steamid": "76561198827115428", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8822\u9a74\uff0c\u4f60\u5c31\u662f\u6b4c\u59ec\u5427\n\u8fd9DLC\u538b\u6839\u5c31\u662f\u534a\u6210\u54c1\uff0c\u4e8c\u4ee3\u7684\u5b9d\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u6284\u90fd\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6284\u5417\uff1f\n\u9694\u51e0\u5e74\u5c31\u8981\u5f00\u4e00\u6b21\u671d\u4f1a\uff0c\u8fd8\u603b\u662f\u4e09\u4e2a\u4eba\uff0c\u7ed9\u7684\u52a0\u6210\u4e5f\u4e0d\u600e\u4e48\u6837\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e86\u5c31\u6210\u5929\u5f53\u70ed\u5fc3\u56fd\u738b\u7ed9\u4e0b\u5c5e\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u4e86\uff0c\u9694\u51e0\u5e74\u5c31\u8981\u70b9\u70b9\u70b9\uff0c\u672c\u6765\u8fd9\u6e38\u620f\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c31\u7e41\u7410\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u9694\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u5c31\u5f97\u8fdb\u5bab\u5ef7\u70b9\u70b9\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e9b\u9e21\u6bdb\u849c\u76ae\u7684\u4e8b\uff0c\u65e0\u4e0d\u65e0\u804a\uff1f\u4e0b\u5c5e\u8bf7\u613f\u4e5f\u633a\u641e\u7b11\uff0c\u8bf7\u613f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5ba3\u79f0\u6743\uff0c\u4e00\u6bdb\u4e0d\u82b1\u5168\u5360\u516c\u7235\u9886\u5730\uff0c\u8fd9\u5408\u7406\u5417\uff1f\n\u6587\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u51d1\u5408\uff0c\u6ca1\u7ec6\u73a9\n\u603b\u4e4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2aDLC\u662f\u707e\u96be\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6ca1\u6709\u5ef6\u957f\u6e38\u620f\u4f53\u9a8c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u6211\u73b0\u5728\u4e00\u770b\u5230\u5f00\u671d\u4f1a\uff0c\u5c31PTSD\u53d1\u4f5c\uff0c\u6068\u4e0d\u5f97\u9000\u51fa\u6e38\u620f\u624d\u597d", "timestamp_created": 1646491401, "timestamp_updated": 1646491401, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497607648372650146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111595424": {"recommendationid": "111595424", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997670575", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "underwhelming", "timestamp_created": 1646485585, "timestamp_updated": 1646485585, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111586331": {"recommendationid": "111586331", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015841307", "num_games_owned": 940, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "french", "review": "Un petit peu d\u00e9\u00e7us par le contenu de ce DLC dit \"majeur\", l'ajout de la \"Court Royale\" pour les rois et les empereurs est plut\u00f4t sympa visuellement bien que quand m\u00eame pas fou et ultra limit\u00e9 dans le fond...\n\n5 Balles max j'en aurais donn\u00e9...", "timestamp_created": 1646476580, "timestamp_updated": 1646476580, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111581319": {"recommendationid": "111581319", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017103266", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I love the full-screen Royal Court, it makes the game much more immersive than the small event images in dialog windows.

Die grundlegende Idee, durch ausr\u00fcstbare Gegenst\u00e4nde und die Hofpolitik mehr Tiefe in das Spiel zu bringen, ist sehr l\u00f6blich. An der Umsetzung muss jedoch noch gefeilt werden. Items bekommt man zu viel und zu leicht. Ich bin als Graf im Jahre 888 gestartet und nach nicht einmal der h\u00e4lfte der Spielzeit habe ich legend\u00e4re Items, die bei mir im Lager versauern, weil ich keinen Platz mehr habe, sie auszustellen. Die h\u00f6fische Politik ist am Anfang zwar ganz nett, die Events werden aber schnell redundant. Es gibt einfach zu wenige von ihnen und irgendwann klickt man sich nur noch durch, ohne den Text zu lesen. Auch schade ist, dass man durch Hof\u00e4mter und Items nicht mehr machen kann, als stupide Boni zu addieren.

Yes. Should it be a DLC? No. \n\nCompared to the DLCs of CK2, Royal Court is closer to a flavour pack. It only affects king+ tier rulers and even excludes tribal lords, making Northern and African rulers less desirable to play as. \n\nThe royal court is supposedly intended to make the characters seem more alive through additional interactions with them. Conversely, I find the opposite effect to be the case. Much like the \"romance scheme\", the characters seem to act or wish for something that is very out of character when it comes to their traits. Such as when I held court and my wife-friend-soulmate came stomping up to my throne in front of my whole court demanding that I grant her the county I had just granted my uncle. An insignificant county of which she had previously had no known relation to, in a duchy of which I was the holder of several other counties I could have granted her instead. Challenging my uncle and steward who had better traits and stats that made him a more competent holder than her, and demanding that I performed an action that would otherwise be considered as tyrannical. It seemed so misplaced and as if the conflict was created just to force a difficult decision, for which there was no good solution, because either one or the other would hate me, or they would dual and either of them would die. As with most of the court decisions that are forced upon the player, they seem misplaced and ruin immersion, and are almost never have a beneficial outcome, meaning, holding court is not something you as a player would like to do and so it does not make gameplay more enjoyable, but on the contrary, it takes away from it. The other court features are interesting enough, but quite minor. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the Royal Court should be part of the game with some tweaking, but I do not think that the content it adds justifies calling it a DLC level expansion and certainly not the price tag. Most of reviews of players I've read that are positive to this \"DLC\" state that they had already payed for the first expansion, and so they do not care about the value for money. It makes it even worse that this was delayed 8 months, meaning we should probably have seen the second DLC by now if the developers had stayed on schedule. Yes, yes, delays come with excuses, but that is the truth of it. CK3 was released 1.5 years ago and it still feels like half the game CK2 was. The Royal Court feels like it was hyped because the developers made an addition in 3D when they are used to making things in 2D. It's a flashy feature that grows boring after 2 hours of gameplay, because it has no substance and does not feel beneficial to gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1646323791, "timestamp_updated": 1646323791, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.773263335227966309", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111452886": {"recommendationid": "111452886", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973129601", "num_games_owned": 357, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I think Paradox kind of painted themselves into a corner with this DLC, and also were the victims of bad luck.\n\nCrusader Kings II wasn't the most feature-complete game at launch, but every major expansion expanded the world and gameplay in ways that felt monumental - Sword of Islam, the Old Gods, and Rajas of India (not my favourite DLC but it did add a lot of content) hugely changed the game, and some of the more iterative packs like Legacy of Rome, Way of Life, and Conclave fleshed out the game in meaningful ways (I also want to mention The Republic which was low-key one of my favourite add-ons to the game). CK3 launched as a much more feature-complete game with two start-dates and an even bigger map than CK2 had, and even though some parts of the map are under-cooked everything was still playable except for republics (boo) and theocracies.\n\nSo here's CK3's first substantial expansion, more than a year after the launch of the base game, after multiple delays which wasn't really Paradox's fault. It is offering a totally re-hauled culture system and tons of interactions for king/emperor-tier characters and their courtiers. And the result is...fine. It's a good add-on that does add depth and decisions, but I can't help but feel underwhelmed. The court features add a nice bit of extra gameplay to your mid-late game and seeing hybrid cultures develop is fun, but for how long this pack was in development, and especially for the price, the end product just falls a bit flat.\n\nIf you're an obsessive CK/Paradox player like me, you will buy this price be damned and you'll enjoy the features it adds because they're mostly good, and that's why I ultimately chose the thumbs-up icon for this review. But this is a pretty unessential pack for people newer to the game or less invested, and the base game has so much content that you won't be left wanting by not picking it up.

Most of what\u2019s worth it was bundled up in there. New version and the 3D courtroom, although pleasant, feels insulting to paying customers. Optimization diminished for some reason and now the game is way more demanding in terms of hardware than it used to be. \nLong review:\nI pre-purchased this DLC along with the other stuff bundled up in the Royal Edition. I Wouldn't have spent a dime on it if I had not pre-purchased it. Everything I've enjoyed about this DLC is included in the free update. That is cultures specifically, artifacts less so but are still a welcome feature. Court positions are\u2026 okay? They\u2019re hardly noticeable as far as gameplay goes. In essence these are three stat modifiers, the Culture aspect being the most intricate, but all in all pretty shallow and unnoticeable, even downright forgettable. \nAll of this is rightful content for a very juicy flavor pack, or a very generous free update. This means you are paying Specifically for the 3D room of the court. And in all honesty, it\u2019s rather underwhelming. Like I said, the least enjoyable part of this entire DLC is what you\u2019re actually paying for. Events related to holding court repeat themselves painfully often, the courtroom interaction with other characters is non-existent, and you can\u00b4t even roam freely in the room. Players pretty much need to wait for a popup to appear indicating there\u2019s some randomized event in the courtroom, like an optional life event you can even bypass if you don\u2019t notice the notification or just don\u2019t care about it. Which, considering this is supposed to be the main attraction of this whole ordeal, is a huge miss in terms of execution and design of an overall neat but ultimately unnecessary addition to the game.  Actual improvements to the game were released in the free update. And while very generous from Paradox, it feels very insulting to the paying customers. That\u2019s why I would advise you to save your money and enjoy the free update, which is ironically the best part of this DLC. \nOn a side note, the game feels rather unoptimized. I run a rather beefy gaming laptop and I swear I had never experienced such high system demands. I don\u2019t know if this is exclusive to the 3D aspect of the court or the entire new version overall. But all in all, it feels as if a lot in terms of performance and system optimization was forfeited in the name of a feature that hardly adds anything to the overall gameplay experience. \nParadox needed a DLC that deepened Ck3, that amplified roleplay and immersion possibilities and brought both Ck2 players craving a more in-depth experience and new players used to a 3D environment and gameplay alike. Instead, they released\u2026 this. Save your money and enjoy the free update, you won\u2019t miss out on anything and may even have a better time than those actually playing with the DLC enabled.", "timestamp_created": 1646147929, "timestamp_updated": 1646147992, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751719295978546143", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111289884": {"recommendationid": "111289884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198843243063", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "turkish", "review": "SONUNDA", "timestamp_created": 1646120747, "timestamp_updated": 1646120747, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495845943689346313", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111270078": {"recommendationid": "111270078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046056341", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The new culture system is a great improvement over the old system, but that was part of the free update.

This DLC focus is more aimed towards the cultural stuff, with the court and artifacts being the big \"luxury\" feature. But I suppose the marketing team thinks it'd be more fascinating for players if it's titled as such.\n\nRoyal Court DLC allows you to play around with your dynasty culture. It tries to mimic the historical cultural divergence, like how whole Holy Roman Empire diverged into multiple kingdoms that each possess their own unique cultures as time goes by. Gameplay wise, it allows you, as an influential leader of your people, to steer your people towards a specific culture and lifestyle that you prefer (if you roleplay), or to benefit (if you prefer to minmax).\n\nCulture and language also plays important part in your expansion. Having vassals that can't communicate properly with you and having different way of life is, of course, not ideal. You will find rapid expansions to be tad more dangerous, and might spell huge problem especially when it's time to pass the crown to your child. In general, you will find that large empires will have a lot of vassals with negative relations with you, and that's where the \"Royal Court\" mechanic comes into play. Having high court grandeur will net you positive relation to pretty much everyone, and this helps offset the negative relations you have with rulers of different cultures. \n\nOr you can just ignore everything I said and basically exploit the heck out of these new features and just conquer everything. Yes, you can do that, but really you always been able to do that without this DLC anyway. \n\nOf course, having artifacts to display and seeing a 3d court with people doing stuffs is a plus, but I do wish they are animated. They just freeze doing very simple animations (like whispering to your character) and the such, and I can tell that they have rather limited budget and time on this, as you can only access the court mechanic when you are at king/queen and emperor/empress level.\n\nOverall I think this DLC is a good offer, and frankly I'm tad confused that some players think the CK 2 DLCs are more worth it. Like come on, while the court mechanic is rather basic, this is basically the very first time Paradox ever dabble in having something 3d and decent looking that are not just live wallpapers. The culture mechanic is fascinating and gives you the options to either play tall and focus as a small but super buff monoculture empire, or go for massive multiculture empire with all the caveats.", "timestamp_created": 1646030996, "timestamp_updated": 1646030996, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.461561024188995361", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111180077": {"recommendationid": "111180077", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993564225", "num_games_owned": 212, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "This expansion adds so little it's embarrassing.

The price IS high for what you get, even factoring in inflation and all that.  Only you can decide if the content is worth the price for you.  If you feel that it isn't, then wait for any of the inevitable sales and buy it then.\n\nWith that said, however, I do feel that this expansion IS worth owning and playing.  The two most common arguments I've seen among the negative reviews I've read are the price and general underwhelming scope of the DLC.  Royal Court may not be a great value for your money, and it may not be the DLC some people wanted it to be, but personally I love the added content.\n\nTo assist you with deciding if this DLC is right for you, at any price, I've put together a little Q & A session specifically calibrated for content from Paradox Interactive.  They have a reputation.  \n\nQ 1:  Does this DLC break the game or make it impossible to play?\n   A:  No. \n\nQ 2:  Does the accompanying version update make playing without the DLC almost or completely impossible?\nA:  No. \n\nQ 3:  Can I live without this DLC?\nA:  Yes.\n\nQ 4:  Will this DLC change the way I play the game?\nA:  Potentially.  You have to be at least a feudal kingdom in order to utilize the actual court aspect of the DLC but you can still acquire relics you can equip at any rank.  The relics themselves can have a very wide range of useful bonuses attached to them, from increasing your vassal limit to boosting your fertility rate, to boosting your combat abilities.  You could both treat all this as just background flavor, or make the acquisition of the best relics one of the main focuses of your campaign.  \n\nQ 5:  Will this DLC warrant me starting up another new campaign?\nA:  Maybe.  Again, the relics aspect can add a lot to your game, but largely everything is just about adding flavor to your campaign.  While the potential is there for an NPC to use a relic you possess that they have a claim to as justification for war (or vice versa), nearly every other aspect of the game is unchanged.  However, the changes to culture that came with the free version update are awesome and, in my opinion, warrant a new campaign on their own.\n\nFinal thoughts:  If you already love the base game, crave some additional flavor in your campaign, and don't mind spending the money, you'll probably love Royal Court.  But it's not going to be for everyone.  The relics do make for an awesome addition to the game but if they don't appeal to you in the slightest then you can ignore this DLC entirely.", "timestamp_created": 1645954321, "timestamp_updated": 1645954321, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75732344388961792", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111137697": {"recommendationid": "111137697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039982298", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Too expensive for what it brings.", "timestamp_created": 1645942926, "timestamp_updated": 1645942926, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 53, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.803383529186248779", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111129106": {"recommendationid": "111129106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141723645", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "DLC\u5f88\u597d\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u52a0\u5165\u62a2\u94b1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e48", "timestamp_created": 1645933186, "timestamp_updated": 1645933186, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111121747": {"recommendationid": "111121747", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271905186", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Very underwhelming and overpriced", "timestamp_created": 1645925006, "timestamp_updated": 1645925006, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706363379955291748", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "111099321": {"recommendationid": "111099321", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096146940", "num_games_owned": 86, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "turkish", "review": "Senelerdir bunun i\u00e7in mi bekledik aq?

It took 125 hours from earliest start date to end date so I have some feedback to give. Im going to give this a hesitant thumbs up. I think there is a decent bit here that I enjoyed that helps round out the game, but it has many flaws and some odd choices in game design, not to mention many, many bugs still in the game.\n\nIm glad they tried something different by adding the court system. It transitions into a new screen where you can visually see your court and change out artifacts and stuff, but to be honest, it sucks that you cant design your court more how you want to. Its cool that you can see artifacts, but why cant you full design your court if that is the point of the system. I suspect multiplayer capabilities would make this difficult so it was rounded down to a more basic function of a very limited amount of designs which is unfortunate.\n\nLets get into some pros and cons from my perspective\n\n-Having equipable items is cool. Yes i understand that this isnt specifically apart of this DLC but it kinda goes with everything because of inspired people.\n-The court itself is cool idea. -side note I had an idea for a new DLC that would be basically jousting tournaments or even gladiator games at the colosseum. With jousting tournaments having different events and based on where its held, weather, terrain, and time of year, or being at war could play different aspects of the tournament. The colosseum could have different types of fights and different creatures like lions, elephants, ect to change up, but this is just an idea i had.\n-Holding court time of every 5 years is fine to me, if i was able to do it more it would be annoying.\n-hybrid cultures and cultural divergence are great improvements to the game, that let you change what you want to do and if you want to also roleplay, more options for you.\n\nCons\n-Im hesitant to say price, because I played for 125 hours and enjoyed myself, so to get it out of the way, I dont think the price is too high. BUT, for a new player who wont pick it up again because of this DLC, I think it is an issue.\n-Grandeur is a missed opportunity. Yes it provides buffs and stuff, but it definately could have been more interesting.\n-NEEDS MORE EVENTS. This for me is this biggest flaw of this DLC. This game needs more events full stop.\n-A big problem for me is your vassels asking for artifacts too often, and if you refuse, you lose 60 opinion. This should be a court plea, or an event that triggered when you hold court with even worse consequences. I played and had the roman empire, I was getting spammed so much for artifacts i just kept clicking and closing them.\n-Another huge issue is getting spammed about item durability. If you have a large empire, I had no joke at one point, 175 artifacts. And it seems that when you switch rulers or something, they lose durability even more because non-stop notifcations for it was just crazy. It got to the point where I would just close them all and have them be destroyed. The game shouldnt make you want to feel like you dont want to deal with your conquest rewards. You need to do something different with your items system.\n-Missed opportunities in general. A few court roles I think are missing. For instance a jailer that maybe gives you dread and makes it less likely people escape from your jail. Grandeur in the form of grandeur events, or getting to choose specific things like culture dishes you serve, or types of fashion.\n-Bugs. Some current bugs I ran into playing. Sometimes when renaming artifacts, it just wont let you because it says the name is too long, no matter what you type. Sometimes the screen flashes white when you clicking into the court. I had a bug where it said i was making negative 3 gold per month, and i was gaining around 12 gold per month. One or two others i forget at the moment, but were there.\n-A final general problem, the spymaster role is boring, uninteresting, and needs reworking or additions. I very much enjoy the added abilities to the marshal, diplomat, and steward. The spymaster is very annoying, and also spams alot with useless information all the time. It needs to have one or two more actions that help give it more depth.\n\n\nOverall I did enjoy my time playing the game and I do think it adds to the overall enjoyment of the game, however it does need to be reworked some and improved upon.\n\nWhat I would like to see for future update and content\n\n-The pope needs a rework. You should be able to destroy the pope for good even if you are christian. It kind of makes no sense he just survives for forever. Like I said before you could even add colosseum update in the same update as the pope since its the same location.\n-Lots of events. More more more events for everything.\n-More fun things to do with the northman. I havnt played them but from my understanding they dont get courts. I dont have a desire to play them because they have less to do.\n-I think two more counselers should be added to the game. One of them should be Hand of the king/queen. This is an event where you get a minor bonus, but i think it could be a council member. One of its abilities could be to antagonize someone, making them more likely to attack you, or even them losing prestige. Royal engineer or something along those lines would be the second one. This would deal with artifacts and buildings and stuff. He would have the option to increase build time, search for artifacts, ect. This would get rid of the spam of ppl saying they have inspirations, which i think should also be a hold court event, and not just pop up all the time. It gets annoying.\n-More stuff for the east, and additionally add more of the world/map. Would like to see a more fleshed out map and more focus on asian culture.\n-Once again as i mentioned before, jousting tournaments. But please have them be alittle indepth with lots of events. I think the dueling system could help and go with it so thats a decent bit of the work done, but it needs to have options and lots of events to be fun. Also maybe special court positions for knights that joust ect.\n\n\nALSO i almost forgot. Counts should be able to make court pleas to the king. Makes no sense that a count cant make demands of a king, even if they are less likely to succeed.\n\nOh and one final thing, WAY MORE CLOTHING AND ACCESSORIES to make characters look cool and feel unique.

Though I have some hard-hitting thoughts. All of this was written from the perspective of a Pre-Y1K Ireland playthrough. And specifically, I couldn't bring myself to play longer than a single character's lifespan. I'll explain, in detail, why I couldn't. The short of it is how everything unravels overnight.\n\nThe one biggest disappointment with this expansion in particular is that I'm struggling to have my artifact sword build a reputation for mass slaughter in duels. (I can't have it win battles since the Commander of an Army does not count for being an active Knight.) Could've sworn that was a selling point, unless I missed something in the fine print. Because I wanted to get a blue \"famed\" weapon not from the craftsmanship, but from having it survive a hundred battles.\nI really, REALLY like the idea of Artifacts being super precious and awesome, though looting the most developed empires seems a lot more profitable than building a locally commissioned sword, reforging it over the span of decades, and using that sword to slay all the enemies across both Britain *AND* France! I mean it, I want MY sword to grow into something more legendary and epic than just \"I pillaged some king with my levy of 20,000 peasants\". The same mindset could be applied to the other fields and types of artifacts (crown for holding diplomatic court, for example, or just having a huge territory being affiliated with my smithed Irish Crown yet that crown still feels puny when I have an empire to rival the biggest and best of the age).\n\nThe dueling, too...With ridiculous prowess, having tailored my character SPECIFICALLY to be an unbeatable God of War (even IN \"Achievement Mode\" where your ruler designer can still have one or two REALLY GOOD traits within their 400 point threshold), duels never ended before 3 or 5 action menus. Not even when my score was \"Excellent\" and I was against an aging Pope who had 0 Prowess! The way the information tries to convey how you're doing feels *RANDOM!* One time, same battle with the Pope, it'd tell me \"We're evenly matched\" and ALSO say \"My form is near flawless, yet his is a disaster.\" How does that MAKE ANY SENSE?!\n\nAnd for the final blow, when running the debug for the duel mechanic (which has a cute Yu-Gi-Oh reference, by the way, something you won't see in normal play), my \"God of War\" has ACTUALLY DIED in dueling against those fools. HOW! I mean, I guess that Martial focus branch was right in saying, \"Luck can win a duel, and a fool can win a battle.\" But when the Prowess disparity is close to 100, I can't help but yell, \"COME ON!\"\n\nAnd I noticed that no matter what the skill level of my councilor, the side effects never fired off (most specifically the martial \"train\" option to improve commanders, I never saw any of them actually improve even when I used debug powers to give a 50/50 chance of an improvement every month or year or whatever the in-game length of time was meant for).\n\nSpeaking of debug, if you think it'd be fun to play as God in this game with console commands, I have to be honest...that gets about as fun as a data entry job. When going full God mode, I find more time typing in the commands to make my whole court immortal than I do steamrolling whole dutchies and reuniting Brittania before the year 900. Admittedly, that's not how Crusader Kings is intended to be experienced, but still, keep that in mind if you ever get so frustrated that you want to show the computer who's boss.\n\nDebug has other cute little Easter Eggs, like \"Errorhoof\" as a reference to \"Glitterhoof\" from Crusader Kings 2. Honestly, I absolutely MISS having a LITERAL \"THUNDERHORSE\" in my court! It gave such great Dethklok vibes, but I get that Crusader Kings 3 is emphasizing \"nothing overtly supernatural\", but still...a shame we lost such an awesome horse.\n\nIn all playthroughs, you are allowed only ONE God-tier character, and it shows. Without turning Crusader Kings into a data entry job, you can't modify your starting spouse, your children WILL get WATERED-DOWN congenital traits if your spouse has none (like the one *I* play as would have \"Herculean\" AND \"Pure Blooded\", the spouse has neither, then our SON would have \"Hale\" and NOT \"Pure Blooded\"). That's even WITH the dynasty perks focusing on breeding the best bloodline. So the only way to prevent this watering-down is absolute sibling-level inbreeding, which as you already know, will give the Inbred trait somewhere. Yet when matched with \"Herculean\", \"Genius\", AND \"Beautiful\", \"Inbred\" and \"Genius\" put together is basically a net-zero, meaning they cancel each other out so you get the same outcome as a common peasant in  terms of raw capability. I presume this is Paradox doing their strict \"Game Balancing\", but it's, again, NOT FUN! It also shows you get only ONE God-tier character, so might as well pack it up when that character dies.\n\nAchievements...most of them are ridiculously specific, and that's not even counting how strict Paradox as a development studio is about what qualifies for \"Achievement Mode\". You can't debug a save, turn off debug, then load that save; it still won't count for achievements. Gotta hand it to them for thinking of EVERYTHING, but man it's frustrating. Don't play this game for the achievements.\n\nMaintaining the court's \"Grandeur\" is a PAINFUL money sink, and with my God-tier character (both in \"Achievement Mode\" AND \"Debug Mode\"), my entire dominion falls to pieces the very moment my character DIES OF OLD AGE! Maybe it's historically accurate for a dynasty of 200 to 500 strong to see inevitable infighting and power vacuums, and also historically accurate for my groomed heir to have a FRACTION of the income as Dear Ol' Ma-an-Pa, or for the land to get cut up and divided among numerous heirs (a problem NOT in Stellaris, which I found more broadly appealing even though I truly want to like Crusader Kings for its more GRANULAR approach to empire-scale strategy and conquest, doubly when Stellaris doesn't let you duel your neighboring emperors to the death in toe-to-toe sword fights OR spar with your Vassals, OR give you the power to rob the weird tentacle aliens of the artifacts they have claimed). On all counts, I imagine that's the way it's supposed to be, though it isn't FUN when my God character creates an indomitable empire with the #1 court in the world, then it all falls apart the moment that character dies. It might as well be GAME OVER at that point, even though that's not the point of Crusader Kings (the POINT is to see your whole LEGACY play out). It's just seeing my work get undone is NOT FUN! \n\nThe dialogue boxes are very plentiful, though after a while, I get tired of every in-game month (roughly 10 seconds of REAL time) having to pause because there are FIVE schemes at court involving random Courtiers, or my WIFE wants to murder my Physician. We're all on the same side, so why are you killing the best doctor in the land?\n\nWhile Steam forces me to a binary decision on \"Do you Recommend\", I totally see where it'd get \"mixed\" reviews, and I'm kinda on the fence myself. The only reason I'm going with \"Yes\" is because I absolute appreciate the \"A for Effort\" that Paradox so far has earned. The core is HERE, it's that there is a GREAT amount of room for improvement.\n\nPlease, Paradox, improve this expansion!", "timestamp_created": 1645813099, "timestamp_updated": 1645813099, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110996684": {"recommendationid": "110996684", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044874039", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Too late too little too pricey :(", "timestamp_created": 1645811093, "timestamp_updated": 1645811093, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110988047": {"recommendationid": "110988047", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069703792", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I pre-purchased CK3, so this DLC was included in the package.

And the game isn't difficult to begin with.\n\nAt this point we can hope they don't back pedal at this point or this is going to look really foolish in hindsight. They have a really good idea with out the Royal Court system works. It just needs to be fleshed out much much further. More cosmetic changes, more interactions, and things like that. I know they probably don't want to come out and really talk to the community much with how this went.

I am a long time PDX and CK fan and have almost all DLCs...except say EU IV for clear reasons of quality. CK 2 DLC even near the end was fantastic. Way of Life added SO much and that was quite late in the lifespan. \n\nThis, this is the most expensive PDX DLC I've ever seen and it's a FRACTION of the content any old DLC ever offered. It's not even a 1/10th as enjoyable or meaningful. I'll be honest, I think it was falsely advertised. They showed lots of images in the dev diaries clearly making it LOOK like there would be animations of drawing daggers etc. in the court. No...nothing. The court is a dead, static place with literally no movement or life AT ALL.\n\nIt's the core of this mod and you almost never open it, not to mention the court is optimised terribly and makes a 3070 kick up to 99% utilisation for no reason. So now CK 3's excellent performance is dropping in quality also. It took them a year and a half to make a 3D room that looks the same no matter what grandeur level you are. No seriously, what have they actually been doing in this time?\n\nBy now CK 2 would have had nearly 4 DLCs with an insane amount more content even in ONE of them. Merchant republics perfect example. That took a few months in comparison. Nothing this DLC adds is actually useful. It's tiny stat bonuses. It adds no depth, no more enjoyment, nothing. It's a damn good thing CK 3 is really fun as it is because this is a SERIOUS misfire for a TWENTY FOUR POUNDS DLC. Insane to even ask that for a SIMS 2 room.\n\nThe only thing I will say, is there is a noticeable increase in fun flavour text again after CK 3 base is dry af in its humour and fun compared to CK2. I'm not saying it needs Cthulu, but my God CK3 base needs flavour events badly.\n\nThe free features are all you need, don't waste half the cost of a FULL GAME on this hit and miss. You'll forget it's even there in an hour. Not to mention it's KINGS only so if you like to play Count, don't bother at all.\n\nThis is half the cost of a new game. Honestly, I feel cheated.

But, I enjoyed myself and found that the additions of Royal Court were more positive than negative, so I'll give it a recommendation. Also of note, I bought the \"Royal Edition\" of CK3 at a reduced cost long before Royal Court came out, which included the DLC, so I didn't get the same sticker shock that most did. These are my thoughts without considering price:\n\nThe Good!\n- It's a neat idea, being able to see your court and the characters inside it adds a lot of flavor to the game in itself.\n- My favorite aspect, the return of \"minor titles\" from CK2 in the form of court duties. Having things like a jester and a cup-bearer adds a nice little extra element. Especially as you expand, you lose track of individual characters, and giving them specific jobs helps create \"I know that guy!\" moments.\n- Language and culture feels better than it did originally (though this may be part of the non-DLC patch)\n- Most of the events weave into existing things well, such as artifacts coming up in schemes.\n\nThe bad!\n- Holding court is, unfortunately, a hassle! It's extremely buggy at the moment (many missing characters or actors that don't make sense, i.e. people asking me to take my own daughter in as my own daughter), but even when it works, it's a tedious and unrewarding process that pops up far too often. There's also an issue with repeating events, though this is a problem with all of CK3 for me (\"a snake at court\" and shocking fornicator secrets happen dozens of times per hour)\n- Artifacts, while a cool idea, have a lot working against them. Durability is a nagging issue, vassals constantly demand artifacts from you (not only annoying, but very damaging to relationships), and the interface (particularly in court and gifting) is very awkward and disfunctional.\n- I'm unsure how it will evolve. It seems like the idea of Royal Court is good, but it's buggy and could use a lot more.. everything. Since it's DLC and not a required part of the main game, it seems like they'll either have to integrate it (defeating the purpose of buying this) or ignore it in future updates and DLC. And, since it's Paradox, we all know there will be a lot more DLC.\n\nSo, overall, I'm recommending Royal Court with a sentiment of \"I like the game more with it than without it\". It always sounded like an ambitious idea while it was being developed, and I don't think they quite delivered what I hoped it was going to be, but.. that's kind of how I feel about everything Paradox does! Ambitious, really cool and complex ideas that end up more than a little busted, and absolutely no idea where they're going next.", "timestamp_created": 1645602247, "timestamp_updated": 1645602247,

DO buy this DLC if you play feudal and clan cultures. \n\nLong: This DLC brings four main additions to the base-game: royal courts, cultural acceptance, hybrid cultures, and extra traditions. \n\nThe Royal Court is geared mostly for Kings and Emperors. Dukes and counts don't get courts, but they can visit the court of their royal/imperial lieges and petition them for one thing or another. As a king/emperor, you get a snazzy throne room where you can spend money on various amenities, artifacts, and courtiers. All three provide *huge* bonuses to prestige, renown, approval, taxes, levies, dread, and a variety of other factors--assuming you generate enough income to cover the burgeoning expenses of your kingdom/empire.  \n\nCulture received a major overhaul. Play nice with a culture, giving land and titles to that culture? Its people will accept you, giving you approval bonuses and even a chance to hybridize. This will allow you pick out the ethos and traditions from two cultures as you create a brand new one. Keep attacking the nobles of a culture, never letting any of them hold titles? Be prepared for stiff approval penalties from both nobles and the general public. You can reduce these penalties through steward projects and learning the local language.\n\nA couple extra traditions round off this DLC, allowing you to mold your culture to better suit your playstyle. While some traditions can be found in the base game, there are the new ones that are particularly interesting. Infinite kingdom-level holy wars, +25 development when building/replacing structures, easily convince unwanted heirs to take religious vows while they're still children... these are just some examples of the added traditions with a huge impact to your game.\n\nOh, and there's the flavor text you get from Royal Court events.

The vast majority of people hating on this are Ck2 stans so let me tell you what,if you enjoy Ck2 thats great go play and enjoy that stop throwing a hissy fit at everything Paradox do for Ck3 just because it doesnt have this or that. Literally its not even 2 years old compared to Ck2 which is over a decade old NO DUH its not as polished yet Ck2 was not perfect on launch either no game is. Stop the toxicity and hate because you cant accept the fact it is not CK2 2.0 deal with it and go play your game leave the new generation of Ck3 fans alone. Legit if all you are gonna do is hate do us all a favor and piss off you spend money and then complain how its not to your standards grow up,\n\nNow as for the actual content I love how there is actually things to spend money on. After the first 40-50 years of the game it feels slow and there is not much to do by the time you get to your third character,so having more things to spend money own is awesome. In addition,having a real use for prestige to add traditions and reform culture is awesome you dont sit there with thousands of prestige wasting away. Having a royal court to see your dynasty grow in power and legend over the centuries feels like your thrown into the world which adds immersion. The addition of court positions makes so much sense given the importance of multiple roles in imperial sociteties that would hold influence. The negatives I have of this are as follows. The court grandure is EXTREMELY annoying. Feels like no matter how much you up it nothing matters and it will drop regardless of how much money you put into it. The models need to be flushed out feels pixilated at times and they look sloppy compared to the court room itself. Lastly the fact tribal nations cannot use the court system but can still have items is stupid. Like what is the point of allowing some features and not others either all or none. This makes the norse dlc irrelevant because now you cant even play as the Vikings if you want to use the royal court so your dlc's should not counter act eachother.Minus a few annoying features this dlc is a step in the right direction for the game. 8.2/10", "timestamp_created": 1645558329, "timestamp_updated": 1645558329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475631266832351685", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110786087": {"recommendationid": "110786087", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043312314", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "It's good, but it's not $30 good.", "timestamp_created": 1645557892, "timestamp_updated": 1645557892, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110783424": {"recommendationid": "110783424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019725059", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "german", "review": "Auf keinen Fall f\u00fcr dieses Geld kaufen.

I do not find it necessary to comment on the price or Paradox DLC policy and do not really take that into the account of my review. I will let that be up to the judgement of the readers.\n\nRoyal Court allows you to interact with your subject by holding court. It also allows you to display artifacts which will give you various bonuses. This is all good, but holding court gets tedious very quickly when those reminders keep popping up and you have the same events happening over and over again. This DLC needs way more events to work out properly. It would be interesting to also see more events that can make an impact on the gameplay. For example you could allow your subjects to construct a holding or establish a merchant's guild. However, most of the time, the events are small and rather insignificant. Could be that is how it is to be a ruler, but CK3 is also a strategy game.\n\nAnd that is where this expansion is not doing its job. The whole Court Grandeur system feels meaningless. There are ten different levels to go through and with bonuses you can get by attaining different levels. You can also choose between different types of courts to get different bonuses. All good in theory, but in practice it feels like there are only 2-3 levels. There is not much strategy involved in advancing the level of your court. It depends solely on your gold income so it is very easy to increase the level of your court. It would have been more interesting if there would have been other requirements and benefits in place to make this a bit more challenging. \n\nSo in short the expansion adds too little for those into RP (events) and too little depth for those who are more into strategy.  The ideas in here are good, but an expansion is supposed to add to the longevity of the game. There is just not that much new here that would add many hours of content to the game. \n\nEven after half a playthrough I feel like I have seen most of what Royal Court has to offer. What I have seen is not bad, but I wanted to see more.

J'ai vu certaines personnes mettre une \u00e9val positive en mentionnant les artefacts par exemple, sauf que cela risque d'induire en erreur les gens.\n\nLe contenu associ\u00e9 \u00e0 ce DLC c'est la salle du tr\u00f4ne, les \u00e9v\u00e9nements li\u00e9s \u00e0 elle, ainsi que la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9former, diverger ou fusionner des cultures. C'est tout. Les artefacts, le rework du syst\u00e8me des cultures, le syst\u00e8me des langues et leur apprentissage, les nouveaux postes de la cour, tout \u00e7a c'est li\u00e9 \u00e0 la MAJ GRATUITE, donc n'allez pas acheter le DLC si c'est ce qui vous int\u00e9resse.\n\n[h1] Ceci \u00e9tant \u00e9clairci, que vaut le DLC ? [/h1]\n\nPour ma part, je d\u00e9note trois gros points n\u00e9gatifs :\n\n[u] Premier point [/u] : Le contenu, forc\u00e9ment. 30 balles pour une mod\u00e9lisation de la cour, qui n'offre gu\u00e8re de personnalisation en plus. Au niveau des \u00e9v\u00e9nements, y en a des int\u00e9ressants, je ne saurais dire s'il y en a en grand nombre ou pas, mais au bout de quelques heures j'en avais d\u00e9j\u00e0 qui revenait souvent.\n\nEt pour rester sur le point du manque de contenu, je rajouterais qu'en plus, la salle du tr\u00f4ne n'a m\u00eame pas \u00e9t\u00e9 totalement exploit\u00e9. Je m'en suis rendu compte en tombant sur un mod du workshop, qui rajoute la possibilit\u00e9 de c\u00e9l\u00e9brer son mariage dans la salle du tr\u00f4ne, et l\u00e0 je me suis dis \"mais oui!\". Pourquoi Paradox n'y a pas pens\u00e9 ? Cela rajouterait une plus-value sur du contenu d\u00e9j\u00e0 existant, et \u00e7a pourrait m\u00eame en rajouter davantage. Imaginez pouvoir organiser des banquets dans sa salle du tr\u00f4ne par exemple.\n\nNon seulement la salle du tr\u00f4ne n'apporte pas grand-chose, mais en plus elle n'a m\u00eame pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement exploit\u00e9e.\n\n[u] Deuxi\u00e8me point [/u] : L'impl\u00e9mentation et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du DLC dans le jeu de base. Pour faire simple, quand vous achetez le DLC et que vous lancez une partie, au final, il se passe quoi de particulier ? Vous jouez comme vous jouez d'habitude, et parfois vous allez avoir un \u00e9l\u00e9ment du DLC qui va venir vous rappeler que oui vous avez claqu\u00e9 de la thunes juste pour \u00e7a. \n\nVous pouvez accorder une audience tous les 5 ans, donc tous les 5 ans vous allez \u00e9couter les dol\u00e9ances des gens, ce qui se traduit par un syst\u00e8me tout \u00e0 fait similaire aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements que l'on a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Ils sont diff\u00e9rents \u00e9videmment (heureusement), et certains sont dr\u00f4les, d'autres int\u00e9ressants, j'ai par exemple eu un dirigeant \u00e9tranger venu me demander qu'il devienne mon vassal, c'est sympa, mais dans l'id\u00e9e c'est des \u00e9v\u00e9nements comme on en conna\u00eet d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans le jeu de base.\n\nParfois vous aurez un \u00e9v\u00e9nement, hors audience accord\u00e9, qui va pop, mais \u00e7a reste un \u00e9v\u00e9nement, avec un petit synopsis et des choix \u00e0 faire.\n\nCe DLC n'apporte fondamentalement rien qui requiert r\u00e9ellement l'attention du joueur au-del\u00e0 de quelques minutes de temps \u00e0 autre, hormis pour une m\u00e9canique en particulier, mais je vais y revenir, et cela est du en partie au fait que : c'est trop facile.\n\nLa m\u00e9canique principale de la salle  du tr\u00f4ne, c'est de devoir g\u00e9rer le niveau de magnificence de la cour, le niveau de grandeur, sauf que c'est beaucoup trop facile. Il n'y a m\u00eame pas r\u00e9ellement besoin de la g\u00e9rer. \u00c0 partir du moment o\u00f9 vous gagnez assez d'argent, vous augmentez les frais, engagez des gens \u00e0 certains postes cl\u00e9s, et voil\u00e0, c'est bon, plus besoin de s'en pr\u00e9occuper outre mesure.\n\n[u] Troisi\u00e8me point [/u] : Donc la m\u00e9canique dont je parlais un peu avant c'est : la r\u00e9forme, la divergence et le m\u00e9tissage des cultures. C'est probablement la m\u00e9canique la plus int\u00e9ressante qu'offre ce DLC, et ce n'est en fait pas une si bonne chose que \u00e7a.\n\nL\u00e0 encore je vais y revenir, mais de tous les ajouts, c'est peut \u00eatre celui qui va accaparer le plus votre attention, parce que d\u00e9j\u00e0 c'est une m\u00e9canique que je trouve ultra int\u00e9ressante, de pouvoir en quelques sorte cr\u00e9er des build de cultures en piochant dans celles des autres (et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat va en \u00eatre consid\u00e9rablement augment\u00e9 avec les flavor pack qui rajouteront des m\u00e9caniques propres \u00e0 chaque culture) mais cela va vous co\u00fbter cher en prestige, vous allez donc chercher \u00e0 en obtenir toujours plus ce qui vous donnera un objectif \u00e0 moyen terme, mais en plus vous allez tout mettre en oeuvre pour que l'acceptation culturelle soit assez haute pour que la fusion des cultures puisse se produire. Demander \u00e0 votre conseiller de travailler l\u00e0-dessus, \u00e9viter de d\u00e9clencher des guerres entre vos cultures, augmenter l'acceptation via les \u00e9v\u00e9nements al\u00e9atoires etc.\n\nBref, c'est certainement la meilleure m\u00e9canique du DLC, mais si je disais un peu avant que ce n'est pas forc\u00e9ment une bonne chose, c'est parce qu'en fait je trouve que cette m\u00e9canique n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec l'id\u00e9e du DLC qui est la Cour Royale. \n\n\u00c7a ne concerne pas la gestion de la cour en fait, et le pire, c'est que ce n'est pas r\u00e9ellement du contenu ajout\u00e9 par le DLC, mais plut\u00f4t du contenu bloqu\u00e9 dans le jeu de base, dont le DLC va permettre de d\u00e9bloquer.\n\nSi on compare \u00e7a avec les religions, c'est comme si dans le jeu de base vous aviez les religions, mais que pour les r\u00e9former ou en cr\u00e9er de nouvelles, il fallait acheter un DLC. Et donc j'en viens \u00e0 ma th\u00e9orie perso : je pense qu'ils ont mis \u00e7a dans le DLC parce qu'en fait, sans \u00e7a, il aurait un contenu totalement rachitique. C'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 pas fameux avec, mais sans, je crois qu'on pourrait clairement parler de DLC inutile. L\u00e0, \u00e7a va cr\u00e9er une esp\u00e8ce de frustration de ne pas avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 une m\u00e9canique hyper int\u00e9ressante, et donc \u00e7a va pousser \u00e0 acheter [b] LE DLC [/b] , qui, si vous ne l'aviez pas compris apr\u00e8s ce pav\u00e9, [b] NE VAUT CLAIREMENT PAS 30 EUROS. [/b]\n\nJ'ai mis un pouce bleu au DLC des Vikings, malgr\u00e9 un contenu malingre, parce que le prix n'\u00e9tait pas abus\u00e9, m\u00eame si un poil exag\u00e9r\u00e9 peut-\u00eatre, mais l\u00e0 c'est non, juste non. Un gros non.\n\nCeci dit, histoire de nuancer un peu, je reconnais volontiers le travail \u00e9norme fourni pour la MAJ Fleur-de-Lis. Oui, le rework du syst\u00e8me des cultures, l'impl\u00e9mentation des artefacts, des langues, l'acceptation culturelle, le travail sur la forme comme sur le fond, est \u00e9norme, je ne dis pas le contraire, et il faut bien avouer que c'est plaisant de voir que, m\u00eame avec le mod\u00e9le \u00e9conomique des DLC, Paradox bosse sur ses MAJ gratuites et ne laisse pas sur le carreau les gens qui ne vont pas acheter les DLC, MAIS, \u00e7a ne justifie pas le prix du DLC. \n\nAu final le plus grand int\u00e9r\u00eat de la salle du tr\u00f4ne, c'est ce que cela apportera gr\u00e2ce aux mods. Les salles du tr\u00f4ne des univers du seigneur des anneaux, game of thrones et j'en passe. En tant que machine \u00e0 fan service \u00e7a va \u00eatre \u00e9norme.\n\nDonc moi ce que je vous dis, c'est que non, \u00e7a ne vaut pas 30 euros, mais par contre, si \u00e7a fait un moment que vous n'avez pas relanc\u00e9 le jeu, et que vous attendiez le DLC pour \u00e7a, ben en fait n'achetez pas le DLC mais profitez de la MAJ gratuite qui, elle, apporte beaucoup, et justifie de relancer une nouvelle partie.\n\nMerci Paradox pour ce contenu de qualit\u00e9 gratuit qu'apporte la MAJ.\n\nPas merci pour ce DLC par contre.", "timestamp_created": 1645466978, "timestamp_updated": 1646089785, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.694804072380065918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110709733": {"recommendationid": "110709733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198029121364", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Too little too late.\n\nAfter more then a year of waiting we got, in essence, a buffed up flavor pack, for a price tag of a full blow expansion.\n\nNo courts for tribal rulers.

At least before you could use your imagination to envisage the conniving, affairs, and intrigue of your loyal and disloyal subjects and courtiers.

You can't.

I should be able to summon people to court to influence what they are doing i.e. any member of my Council at the very least.  I have no sense of being the ruler of complex realm.

Playing as the King of Poland before the dlc came out I had just enough money to do what I wanted, with some hard choices. Now as King of France a much richer country I can do hardly anything because the court even at a most modest level swallows up so much cash.

Is it worth buying? Yes. Are there issues? Also yes:\n\n1. Creating your culture does not spread the culture to provinces in a logical way. E.g. you combine dominant Greek with Bavarian. Instead of the Bavarian provinces in the proximity of Greek ones and vice versa converting it only converted a hand full near the coast of cyprus. Which didnt make any sense at all. It also did not affect any more than just one of my 16 domain holdings.\n2. AI being able to hybridize can ruin your game. Less dominant cultures can make hybrids with yours since the relation between the two is synched. In my case this meant that the handfull of Bulgarians hybridized with Greek and converted large swaths of my Empire with shitty cultural pillars and they even swapped my entire capital duchy and other important holdings.\n3. The Royal Court can be really annoying with the \"holding court\" reminder which you cant really toggle. You also have to spend masses of gold to keep your court grandeur up so that your vassals wont just depose you because mimimi your perfect bread wasnt enough, we want some bread from Mars' soil. \n4. Artifacts are missing some quality of life love. Once you played for a while you will have shitload of trashy artifacts. Sure you could just gift them away or let them crumble. Sadly the latter will most likely cause you to lose important ones as you tend to ignore them. It is unclear to me why there is no toggle for \"keep this artifact intact\" which would cost a tiny monthly cost. Instead you have to scroll through 100 artifacts every couple of years and manually click on multiple buttons to repair them.\n5. Artifact space: there is this gigantic hall with so much space but somehow youre limited to only few spots where you can place your artifacts. Id rather have weaker artifacts but more space to display them. Im sure modders will fix this eventually. \n6. Minor court titles: It is pretty annoying if you have not only the 5 major roles but also 22 minor ones to give away.

I have very high expectations for the next dlc after this dissapointment.\n\nHad this dlc been like half the price I wouldn't have written a negative review.", "timestamp_created": 1645288769, "timestamp_updated": 1645288769, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523140490055084229", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110570152": {"recommendationid": "110570152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038806044", "num_games_owned": 247, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Okay, I DID enjoy this. But I'm always gonna enjoy more CK3. The issue is, would this be worth the US$30 price tag? And the answer is nope. I've now played Royal Court from count to emperor and the additions, though somewhat welcome, are not worth that price.\n\n- The Court Room\nSo, I was really excited to get up to the level where I could have a court and that hype landed like a bit of a wet fart. You can't even actually look around your court. I'm not asking for a total free cam but there's not even a basic rotate. Can my court actually look alive too? With my jester juggling, my musician playing etc? Nope. It is extremely dull. They didn't even think of some kind of glamour shot view to look at your artifacts.\n\n- Artifacts\nSpeaking of artifacts, the interface for putting them in and out is pretty awful, with no comparison tool like many an RPG has when swapping items. And I hope you like renaming the ones you have equipped to remember what they are because when NPCs try to claim them off you, good luck remembering. What's more, you'll end up with a massive stockpile of this crap that you can't even JUST SELL. Nope, ya gotta gift it, so hoarding them does you really no good. I will say it is nifty we now have a system to equip items, it's just janky as heck and the inventory management system is terrible. Oh and I would much rather give solid directions to my artificer than some vague handwave in the general direction of what I want. I have a dozen tapestries and banners and I still only have one small wall object, which I stole.\n\n- Holding Court\nYeah, you'll hate this. Rarely is it anything just good that comes your way when you hold court, unless you are sitting on a mountain of gold to spend on an outcome. The events are very repetitive and most times you'll walk out having spent 100 prestige just to piss off everyone you know.\n\n- Culture\nThe one solidly implemented aspect is culture and language. I enjoyed making my kids learn the language of their bethrothed spouses to be so they had a better chance at happy marriages. I liked modding my culture and checking out potential hybrids.  It was neat seeing the landscape of the world evolve. This is good.\n\nVERDICT\nDLC needs a few big patches. Wait till Royal Court goes on sale for cheap, then snag it.

I always though: Wouldn't it be nice to have a 3d scene with all your courtiers around, now that we have 3d models? Though it certainly never was a top priority for me.\nFor the sake of this review, let's ignore the price-tag and that maybe this shouldn't have been the first DLC and that it took so long (with almost no patches in between) and just have a look at what you get.\n\n[list]\n    [*][b]A 3d court (if you are a king)[/b]:\nTo be precise 4 of them. Each with a few minor texture variations. The thing is: The game covers an area from portugal to india and tibet, from iceland to the subsaharan africa. There are distinct court representations for western europe, the mediterranean, india and one middle eastern looking one for everyone else. I do understand that there aren't distinct visuals for England vs France, but at the very least there should be a eastern europe (slavic), one asian and (at least!) one african court room. By the way, this has nothing to do with the price, just with the scope of the game requiring it. If it's too much work, then don't make such a DLC. Do it right, or don't do it... \nSpeaking of things missing from the 3d court: It doesn't feel alive. Many players report that they rarely look at their court screen, and if you decide to buy this you'll soon understand them. Why? One reason is probably that they didn't invest just a little bit of money into better animations. Also, the sound design for the royal court is off, but I suspect that, to some extend, it might just be bugged: I often don't hear any background music but instead a quite loud and quite low quality background talk recording. Btw, it sounds very much like a latin, so have fun with your indian court...\n    [*][b] You can hold court[/b] (and court events):\n    Sounds great, right? But I'd recommend you don't click that button. Just don't do it.\n    If you do, you'll get 3 petitioners that teleport into your 3d court (because having characters walk around in a 3d scene is black magic and no one can do such things). There are a few types of petitioners: \nA) The two mayors you have never heard about that have some problems with each other. Actually, these events are probably somewhat accurate and dealing with them was certainly part of a kings job. It would really help though, if the mayors were actually your mayors and not the mayors under some count under some duke of yours, because in that case, you really don't care at all.\nB) The meme-guests. They are here to entertain you. At least, maybe the first time you'll see them. Sadly, the number of events is quite limited, so expect them to tell their bad joke more then once.\nC) The characters who are totally confused what they are doing there: A big problem with CK3 (and also this expansion) is that there doesn't seem to be any quality control on events and content designers just make stuff up as quickly as possible (and for some reason even that way they don't event have loads of court events...) and don't think about which event would make sense for which character. So you're wife, the queen will be accused of eating from the royal cake. Your 3-year old son will be accused of being a drunkard, neglecting his duties and fighting your courtiers. You daughter will petition you to take care of her son \"who's dear mama went missing\" - seriously? Aside from these obvious examples, there are quite a few more where characters aren't entirely out of place but certainly acting against their personality and thus breaking immersion.\nThe DLC also comes with great, important decisions like \"change court fashion/architecture\", which do nothing except for giving you a minor modifier. Cool!\n    [*][b]Artefacts[/b]\nLoads of artefacts. Expect to be bombarded with them. Of course, the interface gets cluttered with them quickly and they'll just become a hassle. Despite the vision of \"not have OP artefacts\", a few went under the radar and for example give you the totally sensible superpower of (almost) immortality. Others are just boring. Yeah, balance is a problem in CK3.\nOh and by the way, if you expected the presentation of artefacts in the court room to be cool I'll have to disappoint you. Most of them have generic models (a chest containing stuff, a weapon rack, a diamond). At least a little bit better than crowns which of course your character won't actually wear (because they have no 3d model). Most artefacts in your court feel a bit out of place. Its a court, no a treasury. Also, they decided that you get stat modifiers from the artefacts displayed at your court, so they had to severely limit the number of artefacts you can have at display. And you can only place them at specific slots, so you cannot have a nice looking arrangement of realm/dynasty banners behind your throne.\n    [*]Culture Customisation\n    If you feel like it, you can customise your culture. Like religious customisation, its more of a once in a playthrough thing to make your culture/religion kind of OP or super weird, but hybrid cultures are quite nice when playing a viking and conquering a realm elsewhere. \n   Be warned though, the AI might go a little bit crazy with that feature.\n    [*][b]Grandeur[/b]\n    Nice idea. You can get maximum level grandeur (and insane boni) in 20 years if you have a small kingdom for almost no cost. If your kingdom is large, good luck, because the amenity costs will scale depending on the size of your realm (measured in #counties, not development). It's totally unbalanced, but maybe they'll balance it eventually. Though, to be honest, they haven't balanced the base game features yet, so I'm not very hopeful on that. \n   [*][b]Languages[/b]:\n   Courts have a court language. Not very important, but this feature exists. \n   Languages in itself are a pretty underused feature in general: First of all, you'll need a personal scheme to learn a language, it's gonna take ages and be kind of weird. Then, speaking a language could have far more useful effects. Also, for some reason PDX decided to ignore that most of medieval europe spoke latin and therefore, literally no one in medieval europe speaks latin. Great.\n[/list]\nWhen RC was announced, you might have expected some other features, such as court intrigue features and all kinds of celebrations, from feasts to coronations, funerals and weddings. Yeah, you'll get none of that. Btw, I made a mod to add weddings and it took just a few hours to make, but they had over one year to work on it and did nothing like that. \n\nNote that the coat of arms designer and the culture overhaul base game features and no reason to buy this DLC.\nShould you buy it: Nope. Wait for some time and only buy it if its on sale, they've fixed at least the most obvious problems it has and delivered some missing content post release.

It's just that it has quite a hefty price tag for a DLC of this size and what you do get would be better suited to a free update that launched alongside a DLC pack that actually changes up the gameplay a significant amount. As it is, Royal Court only really offers a distraction and can be completely ignored. Furthermore when you do engage in the royal court's systems, you'll more often than not come across an event sequence that penalises you for engaging with it, with an unbalanced number of choices that lead to penalties (often a resource, such as gold), which can feel like a punch in the gut when you're already struggling to balance income with the new costs that this content brings to the game (on top of every other expense you already have in vanilla CK3). \n\nI feel like the devs could have spent a lot more time fine tuning a experience people wouldn't want to ignore, if they didn't need to break apart and rebuild their code to make these 3D courts etc work. I would be more than happy with a set of 2.5D court screens, it's not like the 3D ones look particularly impressive. They certainly don't compare to the artist's renditions seen as backdrops for your ruler's portrait/character screen. \n\nWhat's also odd (aesthetically) is the inclusion of artefacts and treasures inside the court. It just looks blimin lame having peasants from the city come in and stand next to a precious and highly valuable treasure. When playing multiplayer I noticed a friend of mine had nabbed a valuable ring that when it was displayed in his court was represented by a pile of gold coins and gems that were on the floor by people's feet and looked like a splatter of vomit.

It's ridiculous, and my only suspicion is they want to sell the \"Royal Edition\" making this price a teaser imo. The DLC itself is a nice addiction but holy shit is it lacking in almost everyway. Artifacts suck and are glorified modifiers, events are rehashed and constantly reused, finally are able to create COA without mods but is lacking and should have been included in the base game. Nothing new was added, it uses already created assets from the base game but didnt have an interface to make one, which took over a year to come along. Cultures really are the only thing that are great from this update which really brings a more personalized playstyle which is great for the longevity and modability of the game. All in all I give this DLC a 4/10. They really need to focus on having actual content that the player can use and make it more malleable like the culture system.

Modders are already hard at work expanding the court features to include tribal rulers, weddings, and lesser courts; but that is a reminder that those features are not included by Paradox. The culture overhaul is very good and reflects history more than the previous idea of static \"national\" cultures. The new artifact system already comes with the ability to steal artifacts via the diplomacy skill tree.\n\nDespite these good things, the flagship court systems introduced are too static, infrequent, repetitive, and too disconnected from court events outside of the court screen. Currently the base game 2d event screens feel more dynamic than the 3d court scene, since you currently have minimal control over court architecture, there is no artifact search function, the court fashion decision does not change what your courtiers wear, and food and servants do not appear. In sum, Royal Court feels like early access.\n\nI would recommend this on sale if modders and Paradox expand the court features and framework with more unique events, scenes, and architecture.

I recommend it to anyone who likes CK 3, because I like the new features. The royal court is a good addition to the game. It needs more events and I am sure those will come. The new mechanic for cultures are interesting and create a more believable world, where peoples mixed on a regular basis.\n\nThe free patch makes it even better. Finally we have a real inventory! If you are uncertain about what is free and what is paid look it up in the patch notes 1.5 on the CK 3 Wiki.\n\nMetatalk:\nI rather play the game than writing a review. But this is DLC deserves a vote of confidence. Most negative reviews here are about the price and that is a disservice to the community. Everyone has to decide what their acceptable price is. You can argue all you want about fair prices. Nobody is forced to buy the DLC right now. Paradox DLCs are in sale very often. I recommend to everyone displeased about the price to do a bit of introspection, reflecting about whether they would have given a negative review, if all free content would be DLC-exclusive. Because technically that would improve the price performance measure.\n\nParadox could alter their strategy to make all new features free and create a digital supporter pack for each release instead of giving some features away for free and others in a paid DLC. Paradox could then charge whatever prices they see fit for such supporter packs and I will still buy them without any direct material benefit whatsoever.

Let me put it this way. If I wanted to look at a bunch of awkwardly static people standing around a courtroom I'd go and play Mount and Blade, at least then there's the possibility of getting the visceral satisfaction of bashing some of their annoying heads in.

Of all this, only the last technique is employed by Paradox, unfortunately. \nAlso, events can have checks to not fire in X years, making their appearance more spaced out.

As mentioned in other reviews, there are some brand new *systems* introduced with this that aren't part of the free patch. The modders have already started to put things together based on those systems. Over the long run, that's going to enhance my fun with the game. As for the \"as-is\" aspect of the DLC, I'm having fun with it. Yes, there are lots of randos entering my court with issues I'll see once and then never again. I happen to like that, and that's good for me. True, the court default view is clunky, and I'm limited to what I can hang on the walls and what I can display - my aspirations for becoming The British Museum are curtailed - but I do get the buffs from the gear, and I like that part. I don't play with animations, so I can't use the mod that allows a free camera in the court room, so I do miss out on that. \n\nThe settings for my court stylez are disappointing. I just max them out, build a few more farms to support the cost, and I'm on cruise control to awesomeness. The higher levels should have something necessary to unlock them and occasional nerfs from judgmental churchmen or relatives about extravagance to keep them toned down from time to time. If those extravagances also boosted chances of peasant rebellions, then I'd have a reason to go more Spartan in my court. \n\nThe culture blending is great, I love that part and I love taking time to add/remove/change elements of the culture I'm head of. There's a mod to add more culture slots over time, and I'm thinking of giving that one a go... and that puts me back where I started, planning out my long game with the DLC. \n\nWill the next DLC be US $30? That or more, quite likely. Will it be buggy on release and get better with patches? Undoubtedly. Will there be complaints that it doesn't do enough and, meanwhile, this other mechanic is unaddress? Absolutely. But... will the modders go crazy with it and create add-ons that make it all worth while? YES.\n\nLet me repeat that last line: will the modders make it all worth while?

It's not. It's like looking at a lacklustre screenshot of The Sims 2 - minus most of the charm.\n\n3D objects just aren't Paradox's bag, it seems. The thing is, there's no dynamism. If you increase your court spending, it looks the same. Decrease it, it looks the same. You can add objects, sure, but they're from a limited pool and most look the same as the next or very similar. This is what I really don't understand. We're Grand Strategy players, most - if not all of us - will love reading, and the descriptions for these randomised objects are vivid and charming. So why wasn't the Royal Court an interface like the personal inventory is?\n\nParadox claim it was the 3D court where they sunk all their time, but it's lifeless and vapid. Why didn't they pour all those resources into a brilliant 2D interface - rich in hundreds of 2D representations of court objects - with those colourful descriptions to accompany them? Think how many more events, object portraits, and other things that might have been created in the same time period?\n\nInstead, we got a series of mannequins standing around a bland space that won't change in any meaningful way, which you have to leave the flow of the main game in order to even visit.\n\nGive it a miss, I'd say. But I'm genuinely sorry to say it, because anything that expands the roleplay elements of this amazing game are welcome to me. I just think Paradox should stick to their strengths and do text-based and 2D-object work.\n\nPlus most of the main features which I haven't mentioned are included in the free patch, so obviously I'm not going to review them here when you don't have to fork over $30 to use them! Fortunately, I bought the base game with all the trimmings when it first came out, so the cost was all factored in when I initially purchased it, which takes out the sting somewhat. I couldn't justify buying this separately at this price.\n\nFrankly, I'm more excited to see what the total-conversion modders do with the template they've got! They'll ace the task, of that I'm sure!

faith in Paradox when CK3 was announced. I'm not going to speak in depth about the huge delay between the release of the game and this (which is the first significant DLC/Update). Sike. In my view there really are no excuses for that, and any attempts at such are just inexplicable rallying to a company that cares more about its shareholders than its customers. To an extent this is reasonable, and I'm not in the Paradox management chair but this DLC really is god awful for what it is. Its price can only be justified by the bloated development time. \n\nI believe that there are certainly talented/inspired individuals at Paradox. However, they don't seem to be in control of the scope of long-term development for certain franchises any more (Imperator: Rome, EU 4, and now CK3 sadly). In fact, this experience is very similar to the release of the first (and only) major DLC for I:R albeit that CK3 had a much sturdier foundation. Yet Paradox management seems to have decided that resources where better spent elsewhere as content has been lacking. Northern Lords was an interesting yet minor DLC. However, does it make sense that it took half a year for that to go live? \n\nParadox decided to split their dev studios not too long ago and I believe this is the result. Some are good, but some are struggling. The content from the one's that are struggling are seemingly becoming only more hollow and/or incomplete (i.e.  lacking quality control). \n\nTL;DR THIS SHIT (dlc is not awful but ok at best) IS NOT WORTH 30 OF WHATEVER YOUR LOCAL CURRENCY IS!

Very few events and some of these events requiring conditions to be met, which cuts down the event pool significantly. You will see the same events repeating within a single rulers lifetime (I've gotten the mayor rivalry event multiple times in a row). no real consequences for ignoring your court (Why would I even bother holding court when most of the events lead to negative outcomes when I could just instead refuse to hold court).

If this was an indie outfit making a game on a shoestring budget it would be understandable, but this is a major games developer ten years down the line in a best-selling series who had an opportunity to draw from deep well of player and modder input but instead keeps rehashing the same fundamental errors again and again: abysmal writing (Holy Fury's sainthood line was painful and the devilry of Monks & Mystics was farcical, but at least we didn't have so much in the way of unavoidable fart jokes and meme-baiting pop culture references), poor research and commitment to the setting, woefully unbalanced mechanics, scope overextension (creating vastly more breadth than depth), and features that were clearly developed separately and do not work in concert or are awkwardly inserted into systems for which they were not designed (see the 'language learning' element of the new cultural system, which has been jankily inserted into the 'scheme' mechanic). Where is the pre-release quality control? Such issues with the development culture are thrown into stark relief by the output of unpaid, amateur modders -- some working on their own! -- who continually show up the official Paradox sub-Renaissance Fair content with imaginative, engaging and soulful work.\n\nThis DLC is shallow. The latest of Paradox's ambitious, hyped-up ideas which turn out to be poorly executed is the titular royal court. The devs have put a considerable amount of time and effort into getting a 3D physical room in-game; however, this is revealed to be not much more than a visual gimmick, and an at-times ugly and buggy one at that: clipping issues abound, and as a jumble of artefacts are put on display in the middle of the room the court feels less of a functional, lived-in reception area than a poorly-curated art gallery. The royal court is neither necessary, nor particularly interesting; and as the courts don't really differ in any substantial way except appearance and the odd eunuch, once you've seen one court, you've basically seen them all. This is ironic given the effort also put into the new culture system, but since that also essentialises rich and complex cultures into dull, arbitrary building blocks that can be changed on a whim with sufficient mana, you should expect more memetic weirdness than any real-world flavour.\n\nOn a personal note, as an historian it pains me to keep seeing media that has something to say about history, but doesn't actually seem to be interested in the field of history itself: most of what it does say is not just wrong, but fundamentally misunderstands the process of history and the basics of anthropology, let alone the material culture of its subjects. At this point I would much rather Paradox stop making games with an historical setting, and instead start doing whatever they like in a fantasy world of their own devising. This would allow the developers the creative freedom that they clearly desire, while freeing them of the difficult work of attempting any kind of historical verisimilitude.\n\nIndeed, there are so many basic 'didn't do their research' moments in this DLC: just off the top of my head, this includes (but is not limited to) the lack of the 'Refined Poetry' tradition in any of the Arabic cultures (despite poetry being the most celebrated and omnipresent art form of medieval Arab culture); to the cold, bare stone walls of the Northern/Western European throne rooms (even the most spendthrift monarch would have at least plastered and whitewashed his walls); to the completely un-medieval (and sometimes immature and immersion-breaking) attitudes present in a significant number of event texts.\n\nPop history media makes my job so much harder. I was initially grateful that the Crusader Kings series had given people greater awareness of Islamic civilisation; I am less keen now that I am aware that the cost of basic name recognition is a growing pile of inane nonsense. Avoid this DLC unless it is a necessary prerequisite of one of the several exceptional total conversion mods available for CK3 (and on sale) -- after all, the lively modding community has extraordinary facility of taking broken Paradox ideas and turning them into gold.", "timestamp_created": 1645050166, "timestamp_updated": 1645207845, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.472440958023071289", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110386066": {"recommendationid": "110386066", "author": {"steamid": "76561198384264430", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u70b9\u4e1c\u897f\u548b\u5199\u4e00\u5e74\u7684", "timestamp_created": 1645049991, "timestamp_updated": 1645049991, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110384896": {"recommendationid": "110384896", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043095822", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0413\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0437\u0438\u044f \u043a DLC - \u043f\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0435\u0439\u0441. \u0413\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0441\u044b\u043b\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u044e\u0442. \u041d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c, \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0432\u043b\u0438\u044f\u043d\u0438\u0435 (\"\u043f\u043b\u044e\u0441\u0438\u043a\" \u0443\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b \u043a\u0443\u0434\u0430-\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044b \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430). \u0421\u043a\u0440\u043e\u043b\u043b \u043f\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u043c \u043c\u044b\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0435 \u0441\u0447\u0451\u043b\u043a\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f. \u0418 \u0442.\u043f. \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0451\u043c \u043d\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u043c \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435. \u041a\u0430\u043a \u0442\u0430\u043a-\u0442\u043e? \u041b\u0430\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437 \u043e\u043a\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u0432\u044b\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0447\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437 Esc, \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0447\u0442\u043e \"\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\" \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u044f \u043e\u043a\u043d\u0430 \u0431\u044b\u043b \u0437\u0430 \u044d\u043a\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043c. \u0422\u0430\u043a \u0438 \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043b\u0438, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043e.\n\n\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0447\u043a\u043e\u043c, \u0430 \u0442\u043e \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f DLC.", "timestamp_created": 1645048354, "timestamp_updated": 1645048354, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518297255039215088", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110384106": {"recommendationid": "110384106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021886273", "num_games_owned": 281, "num_reviews": 34, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "It IS good, but WAIT for a sale.\n\n#cuck4paradox", "timestamp_created": 1645047330, "timestamp_updated": 1645047330, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110383859": {"recommendationid": "110383859", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123176255", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "So I'll say that this dlc is a little light if you compare it against the base game, content-for-price.

No... Good dlc? Yes[/b]\n\nSo far ck3 has seen alot more love by the developers than pervious games. \nRoyal Court is a really good dlc, and it shows they really listened to the reviews of bad dlc cashgrab.\nIt's not a huge amount of content but, the content changes alot.\nIts is something you will have every playthrough, it is always relevant. And pretty instrumental into roleplay.\n\nThe cultures system: changing the cultures to make your culture feel more how you want them to be OR what you need on paper, makes it a mainstay is every long playthrough. Before prestige was something u saved at the start of the game, until you hit a point where you are massing 5K, 8K, 10+k prestige and it seemed like a stupid resource. It makes sense that the king, the head of a culture could sway its folks into certain beliefs and directions if he had enough gravitas and importance. \nThe royal court: The inventory is another really baseline mechanic, that intregrates the artifacts system from ck2 very well. You can get these in many manners. Now the royal court itself is personally a very nice addition:\nAs a player who is 50/50 roleplay tactics, i won't always be looking at it and i sometimes wished it was tuned to annoy you less during times of war. On the otherhand, you sometimes get impatient and want to blast 5X speed to get that amount of gold you need for a title, building, holding, etc... It creates a nice breather, that makes it feel a little more like a CK game.\n\nSo the thing is, in any other game this mechanic would be bs. It works for ck3.\n\nI think personally the reviews are a little too harsh. See it like this:\nCK3 unlike europe universalis, vic2, hoi4... is not a tactics grand strategy, it is not a resource management game.\nMany of you will enjoy the game however, as a medieval military strategy game. And good for you!\nI think if you see ck3 as it's supposed to be this DLC will be a no-brainer\n\n[b]Should you buy it?[/b]\nAt full price, probably not. Wait for a sale, or ulterior, LEGAL methods that could save you quite the buck. \nBut you definitely should, all in all. Reviews of base ck3 stated that there is so much to do in your first 200 years, but they die out quickly unless you enjoy map painting. This provides great progression for later in the game that doesn't break immersion or force you to step out of your box. It also provides some nice nuances to make you feel like you're actually playing a game about counts, princes and kings.", "timestamp_created": 1645031735, "timestamp_updated": 1645031735, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110368796": {"recommendationid": "110368796", "author": {"steamid": "76561198893773591", "num_games_owned": 27, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u041e\u0431\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043b, \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043b - \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442 5, \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0443\u044e \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430 - \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u0441\u0442\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043a\u043e \u0436\u0435 \u0438 \u0441\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0443 \u0436\u0435 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u0448\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0441\u044c \u043a 3\u0431\u0435\u043d\u044f\u043c", "timestamp_created": 1645030117, "timestamp_updated": 1645030117, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110365217": {"recommendationid": "110365217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027902432", "num_games_owned": 157, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "german", "review": "top patch/dlc, weiter so Paradox!", "timestamp_created": 1645026170, "timestamp_updated": 1645026170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110364306": {"recommendationid": "110364306", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073276513", "num_games_owned": 148, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u7b49\u4e86\u4e00\u5e74\uff0c\u5c31\u8fd9\uff1f90\u5757\u8fd9\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8822\u9a74\u6240\u6709DLC\u4e2d\u5356\u7684\u6700\u8d35\u7684\u4e00\u6863\u4e86\uff0c\u82b1\u4e86\u90a3\u4e48\u4e45\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u53ef\u8fd9\u91cc\u9762\u7684\u6709\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u5185\u5bb9\u5b9e\u5728\u592a\u5c11\u4e86\u3002\u8fd9\u6b21DLC\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u4e09\u5927\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u5bab\u5ef7\u3001\u5b9d\u7269\u3001\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b97\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u826f\u5fc3\u5916\uff0c\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u53ea\u662f\u591a\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u8ba9\u73a9\u5bb6\u7f13\u89e3\u540e\u671f\u82b1\u4e0d\u51fa\u7684\u5de8\u91cf\u5a01\u671b\u548c\u91d1\u94b1\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u9014\u5f84\u800c\u5df2\u3002\u8981\u662f\u8822\u9a74\u4e0b\u4e2a\u5927\u578bDLC\u8fd8\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u5b50\uff0c\u6211\u770b\u5b83\u79bb\u88ab\u6536\u8d2d\u4e5f\u4e0d\u8fdc\u4e86\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1645025146, "timestamp_updated": 1645025146, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.497942358255386353", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110362261": {"recommendationid": "110362261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044143919", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Sorry to say this, but I would not recommend that anyone buys this DLC.

You can convert (or cleanse, if you prefer) lands to your culture, but then the original culture will gradually start to hate you. Alternatively, you could increase the other culture's acceptance to your culture, and even end up creating a hybrid of the two cultures. \n\nThe royal court and artifacts are good money sink for your gold and provide things to do in the mid game, while waiting for your culture to discover new things. I laughed my arse off when I hired a foreign artisan to design my throne and it ended up looking totally out of place.\n\nAll in all, this DLC is a must-have for CK3.

The royal court DLC is fun, but the features are nowhere near justifiable for the price. It's literally 60% of the base game price with 5% of the base game's features. Think of the games you can buy with \u20ac30 on Steam and this price is outrageous. I have seen DLC worth \u20ac15 with 4 times as many features as this one. Even if you have plenty of money to spend I still don't recommend buying this DLC because it's frankly a grave insult to loyal fans.

The first time you get your courtroom you'll feel excited and hyped to see all the royal stuff you can do (keyword royal as dukes don't get courts, neither do tribals so good luck to those who expected a nice looking viking court) you can \"hold court\" once every 5 years and what that does is spawn random court events that can either help you or be mild annoyances (and also there's no penalty for never ever holding court so what's the point then??? lmao. Like seriously you get random court events whether or not you hold court so you're just saving 75 prestige by not doing it)\n\nAnd the court amenities\nit's hilariously easy to manage the upkeep, my court outshined the one from byzantium purely because I made more money monthly. And you want to prioritize monthly income because the bonuses you get from splendour are really good\n\nOh yeah, that's also a thing. You'll get random events that you won't actually read after the first time. Seriously they scripted like 20 and that's it (and it's the same no matter your culture or location as long as you're a feudal king) someone should count them\nand the whole courtroom isn't varied at all you're locked to a default style according to your culture group so the only thing you can actually \"customize\" is whatever you want to show in your lil museum room which really isn't much, every slot is reserved for a specific kind of artifact\n\nsomething really odd too sometimes the courtroom will tank all of your framerate and sometimes it'll run smoothly. I think you boys could've used a few more days to polish it\n\nThe artifacts thing is cool but also incredibly annoying, you wanna take a rare artifact? oh wait nevermind you didn't know such thing existed but you randomly got it in a single siege along 7 different low tier artifacts to the point that your inventory is scuffed with random stuff you found\nrandom stuff that you can't destroy and the \"gift artifact option\" for some reason is restricted\n\nAnd also, I've been messing with cultures like a madman to test the dlc to its full might and I'm a bit disappointed in the culture fusion feature\nas for the reform culture yeah that one's the best. Anyway\nthey showed us examples of cultures that existed from fusions like the normans, the english and whatnot\nbut when you merge cultures in the game (which by the way can take you more than one lifetime if you don't have a good steward) rreally isn't that interesting\n\n-you get innovations from both culutes (like if you're norse and you merge with greek you'll get a bunch of innovations for free)\n-you get to pick the character naming, the styles of coat of arms (which is pointless because in ck3 EVERY COA looks the same aside from the inner designs)\n-you get to pick the name and map colour \n-only a few counties will convert, yes you have to wait like 10 years per county which is a bummer (did I say wait? I meant promoting culture because counties never convert at will like they did in ck2. Awesome to preserve cultures in your realm, but terrible if you wanna have an efficient demense because you get reduced taxes from wrong cultures)\nBut when you do fuse, very little changes. You might be tinking \"AWESOME I CAN CUSTOMIZE MY COA AND MY KINGDOM'S COA with the little soldier displaying how your troops will look like. And then, when you do create your own new culture you can't customize much of it, only the map display and name (which by the way can only be set ONCE, so if you don't like the colour there's nothing you can do about it). The naming feature is weird, as I mentioned earlier you have to choose either one or both\n\nSo you can have characters named Bj\u00f6rn or Nikomenos in a same family, which is a bit funny, it'd be cool to set our own like \"default list\" of names like culture groups instead of getting forced into those 2 you have\noh by the way, speaking of either one of those, the lil soldiers you see on your map? you can only choose 1 style, and that's permanent, for example either norse or greek. You can't customise that one like at all\n\n\nTl:dr?\nThe main feature is really bland, sorry paradox I know you missed on december to polish this as much as you could but you really didn't make that one feature that interesting\nThe culture features that I'm betting were stripped from the free update to the dlc are kinda worth it\ngives it a lot of roleplay value (lacking some customisation but still about enough, there are unique culture names you can create like Burgundian, Austrian, Rhinelander, etc. I did a run as burgundy and that one felt really nice)\nWorth buying?\nYeah you might want to wait for a discount on this one, it's good to have sure\nbut for that price it's a no-no\nspecially since its main feature doesn't hit the spot\n", "timestamp_created": 1644976053, "timestamp_updated": 1644976053, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.50354611873626709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110330096": {"recommendationid": "110330096", "author": {"steamid": "76561198387194659", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "spanish", "review": "Un buen DLC que complementa la est\u00e9tica de juego y entrega algunas mec\u00e1nicas nuevas con las culturas, artefactos y la corte.", "timestamp_created": 1644973395, "timestamp_updated": 1646780718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110329584": {"recommendationid": "110329584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198111403131", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "german", "review": "Wirklich ein sehr schwaches Update bzw.

Als Startpunkt kann man neben 867 auch 1066 w\u00e4hlen, das Jahr der ber\u00fchmten Schlacht bei Hastings, in der Wilhelm der Eroberer den Grundstein f\u00fcr die normannische Herrschaft \u00fcber England legte und damit das gesamte europ\u00e4ische Gef\u00fcge neu austarierte. Aber spielen k\u00f6nnen wir nicht nur als europ\u00e4ische Gro\u00dfmacht. Die Karte schlie\u00dft im Osten Indien und die Steppenv\u00f6lker ein, reicht bis an die Grenze des chinesischen Reiches. Im S\u00fcden reicht die \u00fcber das Horn von Afrika hinaus bis zum (auch spielbaren) Mogadischu. \n\nUnd spielen k\u00f6nnen wir jeden Herrscher (ab der Gr\u00f6\u00dfe eines Grafen). Ob als ghanaischer K\u00f6nig, als indischer Maharadscha, als Graf von Augsburg oder als uplandischer Jarl. Lediglich Theokratien und Republiken sind (noch) nicht spielbar.\n\nParadox deckt mit seinen historischen Titeln jeweils eine bestimmte Epoche ab. Die herausragende Qualit\u00e4t von diesen Paradox-Titeln liegt in der Erkenntnis, da\u00df jede Epoche eigener Mechaniken bedarf, f\u00fcr jede Epoche eigene politische Agenden wichtig waren, Mentalit\u00e4ten und gesellschaftliche Strukturen in der Geschichte grundverschieden waren. Damit begreift Paradox Diskurse, die etwa durch Michel Foucault (\"Die Ordnung der Dinge\") wesentlich befeuert wurden. Er geht (vereinfacht beschrieben) davon aus, da\u00df jede Epoche einen Zentralpunkt des Denkens hatte. War es im Mittelalter etwa die Religion, tritt in der Neuzeit der Mensch als Individuum in den Fokus. Aus diesem Zentralpunkt ergeben sich dann als Ausflu\u00df wesentliche gesellschaftliche, kulturelle und politische Strukturen.\n\nDieses Prinzip hat Paradox schon seit ihren ersten Titeln begriffen und inkanalisiert, was sie auch wesentlich von anderen Entwicklern unterscheidet, die diese strukturelle Denkleistung nicht vollzogen haben. \n\nMittelalter. Das wichtigste hier: die Dynastie und die Religion. Das Konzept der gro\u00dfen Nationalstaaten existiert noch nicht. Kaiser und K\u00f6nige besitzen nicht das ganze Land \u00fcber das sie herrschen, sondern haben stets begrenzte Macht \u00fcber ihr Vasallen. Und so k\u00f6nnen wir denn auch immer nur eine begrenzte Anzahl an Provinzen selbst besitzen. Kommen wir \u00fcber das Limit, m\u00fcssen wir empfindliche Mali ertragen. Also geben wir eroberte Provinzen lieber an andere Charaktere, an unseren Sohn zum Beispiel und stellen so sicher, da\u00df die Provinz erstmal in der Machtsph\u00e4re unserer Dynastie bleibt. \n\nJeder Charakter hat eine Reihe von Werten wie Diplomatie oder Verwaltung und eine Reihe von Eigenschaften, Tugenden und S\u00fcnden. Hinzu kommt ein neues Schwerpunktsystem, in dem wir uns auf einen Fokusbaum konzentrieren k\u00f6nnen und unseren Charakter, der stets schon mit erblichen Dispositionen ausgestattet ist, so in eine bestimmte Richtung entwickeln k\u00f6nnen. \n\n\u00dcberhaupt ist die Charakterentwicklung, das rollenspielerische, relevanter und umf\u00e4nglicher geworden. Zentrale Charaktereigenschaften sind durch den Avatar direkt sichtbar. Stolze Charaktere etwa tragen die Nase hoch, unm\u00e4\u00dfige neigen zu Fettleibigkeit.\n\nZentral wichtig ist auch nach wie vor der Kampf und die Diplomatie. B\u00fcndnisse werden durch Heiratspolitik geschmiedet. Stehende Heere gibt es noch nicht, sondern alle Truppen m\u00fcssen erst ausgehoben werden. Sehr gut ist das neue System der Ritter, relevanter Einzelk\u00e4mpfer und der Einheiten wie Pikeniere oder Bogensch\u00fctzen, die wir zu den \u00fcblichen Bauerntruppen rekrutieren k\u00f6nnen. \n\n\u00dcberhaupt wurde vieles entschlackt, einiges auch vereinfacht und \u00fcbersichtlicher gemacht. CKIII konzentriert sich auf wesentliche Mechaniken, wie Krieg oder Intrigen, streicht aber auch einige Mechaniken des Vorg\u00e4ngers. Insgesamt tut das der Reihe aber gut, denn alles ist konsequenter, fokussierter und logischer geworden. Die an einigen Ecken noch vermi\u00dfte Komplexit\u00e4t wird sicher paradox\u00fcblich \u00fcber die Jahre noch reichlich ausgebaut werden. \n\nViele Mechaniken k\u00f6nnte man noch beschreiben. Die Verm\u00e4chtnisse etwa, die unseren Dynastiespr\u00f6\u00dflingen schon bei Geburt einen Bonus geben oder das neue System der Druckmittel, mit dem wir andere Charaktere beeinflussen, uns aber auch selber in der Hand eines Anderen wiederfinden k\u00f6nnen. Auch die vervielf\u00e4ltigten Religionen und die M\u00f6glichkeit selber eine Religion zu gr\u00fcnden, sind \u00fcberzeugend. Es fehlen aber Systeme des Vorg\u00e4ngers wie Artefakte oder auch das System der Seuchen. Auch der Ausbau der Provinzen ist eher simpel gehalten.\n\nBei allem Detailkram sei nun aber mal deutlich gesagt: CKIII ist gro\u00dfartig. Noch ist es eine fokussierte Basis, die schon verdammt viel Spa\u00df macht, \u00fcberzeugend funktioniert und sich als ein wunderbarer endloser Geschichtengenerator erweist. Die Geburt ist mehr als gelungen. Die angelegten Strukturen sind besser denn je, die Bedienbarkeit weitaus \u00fcbersichtlicher geworden. Bugs gibt es nur wenige irrelevante. Und wenn auch das Kind noch Erfahrung braucht, sich noch entwickeln mu\u00df, der Spr\u00f6\u00dfling ist jetzt schon ein Genie. \n\nAnders gesagt: CKIII ist zum Niederknien \u00fcberzeugend gut geworden und wird sich im Laufe seiner Entwicklung ohne Frage zum besten Grand-Strategy-Spiel aller Zeiten mausern. \n\nEin Meisterst\u00fcck. \n\nDas DLC \"Royal Court\" kommt - paradox\u00fcblich - zusammen mit einem riesigen Patch, der neue Spielmechaniken einf\u00fchrt, die durch das DLC noch ausdifferenzierter beeinflu\u00dfbar werden. \n\nZentral scheint der erstmals dreidimensional dargestellte Hof, in dem sich alle wichtigen Mitglieder des eigenen Hofes wiederfinden, in dem man Artefakte, Banner und M\u00f6bel ausstellen kann, seine Hofsprache und Hofart festlegen kann und in dem es Ereignisse geben kann, die unsere Entscheidung verlangen. Allerdings ist der Hof nur f\u00fcr K\u00f6nige und Kaiser verf\u00fcgbar. Interessant ist die Hofpracht, die mindestens einem Erwartungswert entsprechen sollte, um diverse Boni abzugreifen. Bei vier Hofannehmnlichkeiten - Mode, Verpflegung, Unterbringung und Dienerschaft - k\u00f6nnen wir entscheiden, wieviel Geld es uns Wert ist, die Hofpracht zu steigern. \n\nSo interessant und optisch prim\u00e4r der Hof auf den ersten Blick wirkt, f\u00fcr mich ist er nicht der einzig relevante Teil des DLCs. So oft wird man die 3D-Ansicht auch gar nicht nutzen. Zudem merkt man, da\u00df Paradox hier ein Modul einf\u00fchrt, das noch einigen Raum f\u00fcr Erweiterung und Ausdifferenzierung bietet. \n\nFast wichtiger scheinen mir die neuen kulturellen und mechanischen M\u00f6glichkeiten, die uns auch in niedrigeren R\u00e4ngen zur Verf\u00fcgung stehen. Es gibt einige neue Hof\u00e4mter, die zu besetzen sind. Der Erzzeugwart kann pers\u00f6nliche Artefakte zu Hofartefakten umschmieden. Als Vasall k\u00f6nnen wir unserem K\u00f6nig huldigen oder eine Petition an ihn richten.\n\nWir haben deutlich mehr Einflu\u00dfm\u00f6glichkeiten auf unsere Kultur. Als Kulturoberhaupt k\u00f6nnen wir Traditionen wechseln. Wir k\u00f6nnen auch eine neue Kultur entwickeln, indem wir uns von unserer bisherigen Kultur abspalten. Wir k\u00f6nnen auch neue Mischkulturen bilden und so die sinnvollsten Vorteile zweier Kulturen verschmelzen. Auch ein neues Verm\u00e4chtnis, das sich auf den Spracherwerb bezieht, kommt hinzu.\n\nDer DLC bietet einen netten 3D-Hof, er bietet aber vor allem eine gro\u00dfe Menge an neuen Mechaniken, die vor allem f\u00fcr den Roleplay-Aspekt des Spieles eine Fundgrube f\u00fcr neue Geschichten bietet. Dadurch entwickelt das DLC den zentralen und wesentlichen Bestandteil von Crusader Kings, n\u00e4mlich den historischen Story-Generator, sinnvoll und facettenreich weiter und vertieft dadurch das Hauptspiel.\n\nNoch immer ist Crusader Kings III weit davon entfernt, die ihm m\u00f6gliche Komplexit\u00e4t auszusch\u00f6pfen, aber die Schritte auf dem Weg dorthin sind deutlich und bestimmt. Immerhin hat der Vorg\u00e4nger auch zehn Jahre Entwicklung genossen, bis er zu dem bekannten Komplexit\u00e4tsmonster mutiert ist\n\n[h1][b]DLC-Wertung: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1644964274, "timestamp_updated": 1644964274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6813468337059021", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110323378": {"recommendationid": "110323378", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058957834", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "\u00d3timo jogo por\u00e9m s\u00f3 vou recomendar quando houver tradu\u00e7\u00e3o para portugu\u00eas.\n\n\"BRAZILIAN PORTUGUESE TRANSLATION NOW\"", "timestamp_created": 1644964045, "timestamp_updated": 1644964045, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525394856929779053", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110323271": {"recommendationid": "110323271", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967358331", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Love it.

For the characters the DLC is relevant to, however, this Expansion really makes the game come alive. \nBefore this expansion I still had the feeling, much like I did (and still sorta do) with Imperator, that CK3 was still not a full game. Sure, it was fun, but a bit lackluster, especially when compared to CK2. And CK2 also has the problem that your court really doesn't mean much. Even with the council having to approve your actions, it was more of a game of making opinion numbers go up to be able to do stuff (and sometimes killing some vassals whose numbers refused to go up ;). \nThis expansion solves both issues. The entire culture mechanic makes for truly interesting gameplay, havint to choose whether it's worth it to hybridize a culture to make your realm more manageable but making conquest of your old culture a bit harder, choosing whether or not to conquer somewhere with a different culture that is going to be a hassle to manage, and so on. It makes me excited to see if they do a religion revamp, as a similar possibility of religion syncretism (as historically happened, for instance, between Muslims and Hindus in northern India) could make the game more interesting in that aspect too. In regard to the court itself, and the artifacts, people are very right to point out the lack of visual changes. The court does change it's look when changing grandeur levels, but the changes are so subtle they can easily go unnoticed. However, I don't exactly play paradox titles for the looks, but for the game, and the court events and artifacts are very good at telling a story and making gameplay more varied. It is very interesting, for example, when you pay someone to make you a sword and your wife, who knows nothing about fighting, decides she want's to give an opinion on how it's made, and you have to choose between making her sad or getting a worse sword. The court positions are, for me, the star of the Expansion. The fact that the courtier's abilities are relevant to their position and that they truly change the game, be it by giving you bonuses or by allowing you different decisions, really stands out against CK2's court positions that merely made people happier. And courtiers may get mad if you give a position to someone they consider less important, which makes juggling expectations something that you actually have to do.\nOverall, this Expansion is worth it. It is a bit expensive, and maybe it should have been part of the base game, but I do think it is a great expansion and a step in the right direction to make CK3 really stand out among paradox titles and grand strategy games in general.", "timestamp_created": 1644946267, "timestamp_updated": 1644946267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110306092": {"recommendationid": "110306092", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069582469", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Although I like the content introduced (in general), there are too many problems for me to recommend it at the $34 price.\n\nTo begin, the crashes.

Since the new update and DLC, the game only starts up properly about a third to a half of the time on first try. Not only that, but I have had 3 crashes while playing for seemingly no reason, which is extremely frustrating when the game takes like 15 minutes to load up again. Related to this is the hardware-intensiveness of the actual Royal Court. Now, my computer isn't anything crazy, but it is a good computer and doesn't have any problems running CK3 normally.

This is something immediately noticeable as soon as you start the game and it's especially annoying considering it was added in a DLC focused on graphics.

Changing or customizing cultures is basically only relevant very late game when you have nothing better to use your prestige on. \n\nVisually Modeled Courts: Watch a series of bland static images play out in a court room that looks functionally identical to every other court around you regardless of your wealth or power. You can't customize anything substantial, it adds nothing visually to the events other than the occasional character model standing motionless in front of you, and you'll basically just ignore the screen until you're forced to interact with a random popup event. Want to watch feasts, weddings, assassination attempts, executions, coronations, and more? Well maybe one day you can spend another $30 to see those things, for now you're out of luck.\n\nNew Events: Every new event pretty much comes down to a single choice between a few options where you just pick the one with the best chance of randomly landing on a good result. Watch as you're forced to make countless inconsequential dice rolls that usually just affect your popularity in a random county or make a certain mayor you didn't know existed slightly mad at you, and basically nothing else.\n\nArtifacts: Constantly accrue more minor stat changes attached to copy-and-paste junk that is tedious to get rid of. Only a few of the historic / legendary artifacts offer any kind of interesting bonuses, but getting them is purely random chance. There also seems to be a grand total of 5 different artifact models in the game to show off. Who knew the Iron Crown of the Lombards looked exactly the same as the cheap copper one I paid a random metal smith to make for 20 bucks?\n\nGrandeur: What could be more dynamic and fun than constantly pay some of your gold income for more minor stat changes? Yup, that's pretty much all it is. \n\nOverall, the Royal Court experience was bland, uninspired, and left the gameplay feeling essentially unchanged.

If you are interested in roleplay in CK3, this DLC is essential. Otherwise, don't buy it.\n\nFirstly, the culture overhaul. For the first time in a paradox game, culture is important and something that you actually think about. Each culture has at least 3 traditions, with each tradition adding more flavour and potential for roleplay. The genius of this system comes from it's modularity. New traditions can be added or swapped in for a cost of prestige. The cost is reduced if you fulfil certain requirements e.g having 5 cynical counts of your culture reduces the cost for \"Life is just a joke\". This system discourages minmaxing (somewhat) and encourages you to choose traditions which make sense for the story you are creating. However, these changes take time to implement, thus you can diverge your culture, allowing you to swap out any of your traditions (costs applied) immediately. This adds massive storytelling potential e.g An independent Epirus may diverge from their Byzantine forebears, or may diverge even as a vassal.\nIf 2 cultures have high enough acceptance (usually 40%), they can hybridise, taking a mix of the traditions and pillars of the parent cultures to form something wholly unique. Finally, I can merge Irish and Italian cultures to create potato-based pasta (that's just gnocchi but you get the idea). \nAnd yes, the AI does utilise these features. I've seen some interesting creations such as Greco-Bulgarian or the monstrous Croato-Carato-Franconian. Thankfully, how frequent the AI diverges and hybridises is at the player's discretion, in case you wish to prevent the emergence of Afgan-Polish-Franco-Afgan-Albanian.\nWhilst the overhaul of culture is part of the free patch alongside the update, hybridising and diverging culture are DLC features.\n\nNext, there is the artifact system, which is executed more elegantly than in CK2. You can commission specific artifacts, or loot them from others but the main method of acquisition is by sponsoring guests' inspirations. Whilst this can get frustrating if you are after a specific type of artifact, it does add a sense of excitement to the system- there is no surefire way to know what exactly you are about to receive. There is a system for artifact claims, but unless you are in the habit of getting raided, nasty succession, or borderline exploits, they don't factor much into gameplay.\nWhilst the system adds great potential to storytelling as a battle-winning axe becomes a treasured heirloom, I found I was often swamped by a deluge of low-quality artifacts, mainly attained from sieges or random inheritance. The constant supply of trash made it difficult to navigate through menu's to see the artifacts that mattered. My Queen's prized dagger was buried beneath a pile of more, identical and worthless ones. I wish there was a mechanic for artifact quality to improve as certain weapons or pieces of armour become instrumental in the history of the Polish-French people, Except there is a system for that, kind of, Your dynasty banner gets upgraded as you gain more renown, and some artifacts gain extra effects or flavour text over time. Unfortunately, without a straight increase from Fine to Masterwork level, this difference is hard to spot at a glance. There is also no convenient way to get rid of artifacts- there is a reason that a popular mod lets you auction them off. The system is definitely an improvement over CK2's but it just needs to go a bit further to be truly great.\n\nFinally, the titular Royal Court system is a great addition to the game. It feels great to fill my courtroom with rare artifacts, although I feel that there aren't enough slots for all of my most prized possessions- perhaps a slightly larger court for emperors would work best? Holding court is a great bit of roleplay, along with the court events. However, these events begin to feel a bit repetitive, and a few dozen more of them would  be much appreciated.\nMany in the community feel that the restriction of courts to Kings and Emperors is unfair and that dukes should also have access to this new feature. Whilst I understand the frustration, the restriction is most likely down to performance- there are far more dukes than kings and emperors, thus if each duke owned a royal court, there could be significant slowdown. The best solution would be an option to enable duke courts for beefier systems, although I am fine without duke courts for now.\n\nDespite the high price, I do feel that Royal Court is worth buying due to the new depth in roleplay and a massive increase in options for storytelling. Not every addition is perfect (the language system is so minor I forgot to mention it in this review), but the breadth of new narratives to create is worth the asking price. If you just aren't into roleplay in grand strategy games, then this DLC may not be for you.", "timestamp_created": 1644871842, "timestamp_updated": 1644871842, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

Most of the important stuff you will get with the free update anyway. \n\nThe majority of the paid content is gated by only being available to non-tribal Kings and Emperors. The 3D courtroom is ugly, a glorified diorama since you can't move around it freely. Also, there's only 4 variations of the courtroom, so there will be a lot of unimmersive overlap. Court decisions are extremely repetitive, and they don't impact your game as much as you'd want to; aside from a couple that I won't spoil here. Artifacts are busted and op, they make the game even easier than it was before.\n\nCulture overhaul is AMAZING, though not really part of the paid content since that comes up with the free patch. You pay to be able to diverge, hybridize and reform your culture. Which is pretty cool, to be fair. This allows the player to forge their own distinct culture from the rest. \n\nIn the end, if you paid, half of this DLC is severely lacking, and the other half OK. Both of these do not add up to $30.

Sick move mixing gender laws into two different aspects of the game that aren't tied to each other and can cancel each other out, who could have foreseen the consequences? Additionally there is ABSOLUTELY NO historical context for this. There would be more historical context adding this to the vikings than here, and on top of that you made an unplayable game state. \n\nLook I get you want to make fantasy experiences happen at the fringe civilizations of the game but maybe make it mechanically functional.

It's all optional, so you don't have to hold court or engage with the mechanics, which is kind of a plus because after a few hours they're already kind of tedious (Plus the court itself doesn't look good with the lighting being all washed out and uber-bright, not to mention characters' eyes and stiff poses. I'd rather it be dark and realistic looking so I didn't have to see how awkward everyone looks). \n\nIt's not all bad - artifacts and court artifacts are a welcome addition as something that felt missing when CK3 released. \n\nCourt events seem a bit skewed to the point that holding court is straight up dangerous; my half-brother and friend who was imprisoned by another king showed up at court and tried to murder me despite being imprisoned and having +80 opinion. Another time a random mayor who wasn't in any factions drew a knife and disfigured me, my wife, and my seneschal for unknown reasons (Opinion +10). Alrighty then.\n\nIt's also not very multiplayer friendly, as you're either rushing to click through as fast as you can or you're sighing as your friend takes too long to finish and unpause.

Culture changes was a wet dream of a lot of ck2 players for forever, and ck3 got it in FIRST DLC. As well as expanded artifact system, but I wish it actually added more actual progression. Court building (or what is it?) should be a buildable and expandable entity, accessible from any rank and to any government, limiting you only with how much it costs. Language things are too much micro, court titles are a lot of micro too. That's what OLD CK fans would be more tolerant to, but not the broad community that ck3 managed to gather. Devs managed to get to the next level of accessibility with main game, but failed to do so with an expansion.\nI give it a thumb up just for culture mechanic.

Also, why waste so much time and resources to create it in 3D while it basically gives the same results of normal events? It's pointless and the visuals are mediocre at best.\nThe artifacts aren't bad per se, but they lead to the same kind of power creep that Jade Dragon introduced in the final years of CK2, making the game easier and easier while the dynasty gradually piles up items. Giving it high priority imho isn't a good sign.\nThe new culture system is probably the best mechanic of the dlc, but imho atm there is little reason to stay committed to a campaign long enough to really make it shine.\n\nTL;DR: overhyped and vastly overpriced but underwhelming.\n\nHope the devs will ramp up the porting of CK2 mechanics and events to give CK3 the much needed variety instead of going down the The Sims road, otherwise this will be the last dlc I'll buy for a long, long time.\n\nFeb 27th edit: almost 3 weeks after the release and the bug preventing Councilors tasks events from firing hasn't been fixed despite being a major issue.

But it adds much needed content, so if you love the game, then it's a must have. Get it on sale. I would say it's worth 15\u20ac.\n\nA few things I noticed:\n1. The gear that you equip does not change your visuals at all - it is just another stat for your character. This is quite a shame for a game that has 3D characters that change clothes based on culture or rank. If you are a king, you have a crown displayed even though you have no crown. This is a bit stupid.\n2. The royal courts are fairly similar - apart from the cultural differences. My own royal court didn't change all that much from when I got my first king to my last emporer. It was the same glorified shed I started with as king.\n3. Over the course of a normal ironman game I got so much gear that it felt like I had too much gear. The good gear, is not THAT much better than the bad gear. If I lost some gear, I certainly wouldn't start a war to get it back.\n4. I noticed a bug or two, that I dont know if it's just part of the base game. I asked for a divorce, paid the piety cost, the pope accepted it... but I am still married and got no popup or anything explaining why.\n\nThis would have been a \"yes\" recommendation if gear was displayed on characters (even at 30\u20ac).

The former adds a lot of flavor to the game and more to do if you're into acting out more the whole being a ruler aspect. The artifacts are also a nice addition, being able to forge that crown that your dynasty passes down for generations. Then the culture is an amazing change that definitely adds more to the realism aspect. Now if you're a viking that conquers India you no longer have to simply become the local culture or create a random Nordic area surrounded by completely unreleated cultures, you can now combine the two and become Indian vikings. Live out various what if scenarios, what if the Pechenegs decided to settle down in Georgia and merge with the local peoples, what if French nobles slowly integrated with the local culture in Flanders forming a new distinct identity, do as you wish.\n\nThe issue with this DLC is that these features aren't game changing to the actual mechanics of the game, as even though the culture mechanics are completely revamped they're not really something you're going to be interacting with more than a handful of times throughout the game. For the people that simply play these types of games to paint the biggest empire of the map you're not going to get anything out of this pack, and unless you just really want these features I'd honestly wait on a sale since $30.00 is definitely a bit much for whats provided.\n\n I like the direction they're taking with the DLCs for CK3, leaning more into adding more to the flavor of the game and giving more to do as we live our royal in game lives rather than doing a major war overhaul for example.

It is obvious from a game design perspective why ducal courts and below are not implemented, and while it would have been nice, considering the amount of actors in the game it would have been madness.

And goals, this DLC gives you plenty : get a beast economy to pay for your massive royal spending, dress up your court nice ; find those forgotten daughters of your dynasty who were buried in the menus now hanging in front of  your throne (and all the other characters for tha matter ) ! \n\nThat last part is the massive game changer for me. The court. It's not cosmetic. So many fantastic opportunities I found out about, just by seeing who is who today !  And the artefacts too are a game changers. Aristocracy as it's core is about spending money on luxury items instead of infrastructure development. Before you could only spend money on the growth of the kingdom ( lol ) now it's all about who has the most treasures. I won't call them trinkets, because they are powerful items in their own rights, even those you don't use are a potent gift, and those in you inventory can be re-purposed for your throne room ! \n\nCulture changes are excellent, a fantastic prestige sink. Some religious tenets were turned into culture, meaning less hard choices to create the socio-religious build of your dreams !\n\nI will say this, if you do not enjoy this expansion, I am sorry to say you don't play the game right. I get some feel the game needs more events to feel complete, but the system, the opportunities, the family drama is already there.\n\nI did not pay for a single episode of Game of Thrones.

At the end of the day there is no way you can argue that what's on offer is worth the $30 price tag. What we did get essentially boils down to the following:\n\n- The so called \"Royal Court\" which was over hyped by the devs to the extreme. \n   > Rather mediocre character models \n   > Reused animations from the base game \n   > Some of the weirdest and frankly annoying court events that frequently produce more negative effects than positive. I \n   mean they have a court event for leaky latrines but not like a wedding event or a real feast event to see any of the court \n   amenities you shell out gold for.\n   > The aforementioned court amenities; Fashion which never visually changes, Food, Servants, and Rooms. \n   > Oh and you have to be at least a king and either feudal or clan to even have any of this so if you're a count, duke, or tribal too bad you don't even have access to any of the previously mentioned things.\n   > There's also a court splendor level which doesn't have any visual changes, only stat changes. \n   > Only a handful of court types with little variation for different regions, cultures, religions, etc \n\n- The artifacts system from CK2 makes it's return and it's a mixed bag. The court artifacts are pretty interesting but are very poorly placed in the court that makes your court look more like a history museum exhibit than an actual noble court. The personal artifacts however are pretty much just glorified stat modifiers. None with the exception of your weapon are visible and even that is only visible in duels.\n\n- And finally the culture overhaul which expands cultures a bit and does make them a bit more interesting but not enough to be game changers like the devs claim. The divergence and hybridization features are cool and allow for interesting combos but once again nothing game changing considering the asking price\n\nIn review the devs seem to think that just because it took them 18 months to figure out how to code the royal court visuals (which are rather mediocre mind you) somehow justifies charging over half of the price of the base game for a what is essentially a few gimmicks and no substantial content that will open up more interesting scenarios or change the way you approach a playthrough. This especially when compared to the Northern Lords culture pack that made playing the vikings so much more interesting and added new and meaningful features all for a $7 price tag. They really hyped this dlc up, treated it like it was a Far East expansion (now that I would pay $30 for), and took a year and a half of dev time all for something that I would barely justify paying $10 for let alone $30. I would say wait for a very deep sale to pick this up and don't waste your money because this definitely isn't worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1644813945, "timestamp_updated": 1644814765, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 229, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.900823652744293213", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110201906": {"recommendationid": "110201906", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017108944", "num_games_owned": 126, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Garbage.

Months of devblogs illustrated in great detail exactly what would be added in this expansion pack. There were no surprises here. \n\nFor me, it added a good amount of day to day king activities to help fill the time between wars and succession crises. The throne room is actually really cool and the character models themselves have improved a lot alongside it. The bonuses are great including some pretty powerful perks and even new councillor tasks. Plus, I just like poking my head into it to see who is mulling around and sometimes meeting new people or commissioning new inspirations. Getting to look at other people's courts is nice too, as I can immediately see who's who, which helps me plan my intrigue ops. Overall, it feels like a big gap in game play was filled by this expansion and it executes on its vision and promise flawlessly. I also found the new culture system to be more impactful than I expected. The bonuses are pretty good, and it isn't hard to add new ones. I have enjoyed modeling my culture around the particulars of its place and time in history. \n\nMy primary nitpick is that Dukes are not allowed to have courts. Some of the most famous courts in history belonged to duchies and it seems like some sort of allowance could have been made in this mechanic for Dukes. I enjoy playing at the lower ranks, but now I am missing out on most of what this expansion has to offer if I do.

In other words, this is something that would be cool, for $15 bucks (half the cost) after a bunch of other content was filled-in via other DLCs. \n\nI mean, 3D throne room is a good idea for immersion, and culture and court language also help for immersion as well.\n\nBut there are a lot of places that could have been filled in prior to the spots Royal Court touched on. More bookmarked start dates (beyond, you know, 867 and 1066) would have been a good initial addition that doesn't happen here. Further, law-setting and more tools for running your fiefdom would have been great... this DLC *kinda* adds a bit of that with some of the cultural stuff, but basic government options are missing. Prior to having high crown authority, it would really help if there were more tools to keep rivals and factions in-line rather than so often resorting to intrigue. \n\nWhich gets me to maybe the most egregious problem with Royal Court: it adds so little to the start of a new game. You don't even get the court until you achieve a high enough rank, so duchies and counties play pretty much the same as always. Byzantines and a couple others do get a lot right away (the court, but also a few artifacts already).

I also like to start out as a Duke and, since only kings get a royal court, this DLC is again somewhat pointless for me. \n\nI did try out a game as a king so I could comment with some experience on the actual features, and some of it was definitely fun. It does get old fast, and once you have large court, you will have piles of pointless artifacts. I'm glad they added these features, but it definitely hasn't been a game changer for me.\n\nFor a $30 DLC, I'm pretty disappointed they didn't give tribal governments some type of royal court. If I bought this as a standalone purchase and not part of the Royal Edition, I'd be extra annoyed. A quick browse of the Steam top selling games highlights that $30 can buy some pretty amazing full games. Not even counting the sale price games, this DLC is more expensive than Stardew Valley, Project Zomboid, and Valheim, 3 games that I've each had hundreds of hours of fun with.

Yet these have the most generic designs imaginable - a sword is just a 2d image which you can't do anything with by the way. It would be too much to ask for a dlc that's based around the idea of displaying stuff in 3d to show you the \"rare\" armour you're wearing! Same with artefacts which you can't see in your court (most are just boxes) \n\nThe entire DLC is essentially just an amalgamation of different modifiers that you could easily go through the entire play through without even noticing; that's how inconsequential they are.\n\nFinally you have the most grandiose court in the world, with top notch fashion and food? I doubt you'll notice it as the court looks exactly the same no matter how much you invest in it!

I think people complaining seem to be mostly people who don't like the price, which I am not going to get into. Others don't think it adds anything, and I think this is more the people that play this as purely a grand strategy and don't get into the story telling and characters in the game. The main things it adds are culture changes, the royal court/holding court, and artifact crafting and displaying/equipping. \n\n1 - The cultural changes. I think these are good, but can be better. I love the idea that you can merge cultures to create custom cultures from the two. I am now paying attention to my culture and actually trying to create and merge cultures to make my culture stronger. I used to just stick with the culture I started with for the entire game. I still don't love the cultural research aspect of it, but that hasn't really changed\n\n2 - The royal court/holding court. Its fun to see your court, but not for everyone. While CK games are 4x, they have an aspect of role playing and characters that make them stand out for me. Seeing the characters that make your story is interesting, but its pretty static. Its more for the people that don't purely play it as a grand strategy. Holding court is done well. Instead of getting constant popups, there are a bunch of events that you can roll through when it is convenient for you. If you are in the middle of a crusade or war, you can wait until you're done to go through all of them. They have a lot of flavor, and I haven't seen many repeats. Again, this is probably for the people that don't purely play this as a grand strategy and like the stories and the characters.\n\n3 - Artifact systems - I love these and they are done far better than CK2. Instead of just hiring a smith and paying absurd amounts of money, the system has inspired people with different levels of skill and different events that affect the quality. There are slots and maximum amounts of items that can be equipped, there are inheritances and the ability to demand artifacts back. Its just overall a really good system, and for me this adds a lot.

The Court system, and a new culture system among others. I've enjoyed the time I've played with it, as it adds a fresh coat of paint to the CK3 experience. It also adds a decent amount of modding ability for the modders out there. The biggest gripe most people have with it is the pricing, which I can't say I disagree with. It is a bit overpriced for the content added, however in my case I've negated my buyer's regret type of thing by getting the expansion pass... This was the first time I've ever pre-bought a game or dlc for a game. It lives up to the hype in my mind. I would buy it again if I had to, but I would probably wait for a sale.\n\nFor the first time buyer/player, I'd highly suggest waiting for a sale, maybe like 10-30% off is best. If you can or can't wait for a sale, get the bundle. You pay for TRC and NL, and also get 2 flavor packs essentially for free. Though I must note when I bought the expansion pass I already had bought NL, so my math may not be perfect.\n\nI hope this helped any future buyers!", "timestamp_created": 1644772140, "timestamp_updated": 1644772140, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110161341": {"recommendationid": "110161341", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987514015", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Made the game much better with far better immersion.", "timestamp_created": 1644772124, "timestamp_updated": 1644772124, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110160594": {"recommendationid": "110160594", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272124953", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u96d6\u7136\u5bae\u5ef7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6709\u4e9b\u662f\u539f\u7248\u91cd\u8907\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u597d\u6b79\u6709\u52a0\u65b0\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5bae\u5ef7\u7b49\u7d1a\u9ad8\u80fd\u52a0\u597d\u611f\uff0c\u6b64\u5916\u5bae\u5ef7\u7b49\u7d1a\u548c\u5bf6\u7269\u90fd\u80fd\u628a\u4e4b\u524d\u7248\u672c\u9577\u5f97\u5f88\u6162\u7684\u5b97\u65cf\u5a01\u671b\u6f32\u5f97\u98db\u5feb\uff0c\u6b64\u5916\u5bae\u5ef7\u7b49\u7d1a\u4e5f\u6703\u52a0\u9818\u5730\u6c11\u773e\u597d\u611f\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bae\u5ef7\u985e\u578b\u4e5f\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684buff\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u9084\u80fd\u52a0\u76f8\u5c0d\u61c9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0cex\uff1a\u7ba1\u7406\u578b\u5bae\u5ef7\u80fd\u8b93\u5f85\u8d8a\u4e45\u7684\u5ef7\u81e3\u52a0\u7ba1\u7406\u503c\u3002\n\n\u6587\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5c01\u5efa\u570b\u5bb6\u80fd\u5b78\u6230\u570b\u6642\u4ee3\u7684\u8d99\u570b\u641e\u80e1\u670d\u9a0e\u5c04\uff0c\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e0a\u7248\u672c\u9577\u671f\u4f4f\u5728\u7570\u6587\u5316\u800c\u6642\u5e38\u53db\u4e82\u7684\u5916\u4f86\u8cb4\u65cf\u5728\u9019\u7248\u672c\u5c31\u5f9e\u52a3\u52e2\u8b8a\u512a\u52e2\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5c31\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u539f\u6587\u5316\u7684\u512a\u52e2\u4e0b\u641e\u5b9a\u7576\u5730\u7684\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\uff0c\u9019dlc\u7e3d\u9ad4\u4f86\u8aaa\u5229\u5927\u65bc\u5f0a", "timestamp_created": 1644771633, "timestamp_updated": 1644771633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110159905": {"recommendationid": "110159905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198006525357", "num_games_owned": 201, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "A very soft \"not recommend\" as I do think the new cultural and artifact systems add value.

Plus, the court room itself doesn't change, so while it seems like it would work fine for a Count at first, when you get to Emperor it feel s like you're ruling from an unfinished closet.

The royal court itself isnt at all intrusive nor impedes game play in anyway. Its pretty dope to see your character actually rule improving immersion a fair bit. I think Paradox did right by focusing on the story element of the game, getting you to actually interact with your courtiers by not having them just be 'there'. The cultural rework speaks for itself as its much needed and they did an excellent on it, getting cultures to actually be different and play differently. Story and characters are the core of what makes crusader kings, Crusader Kings. So im glad to see their really focusing on that aspect first, i think taking certain elements from other GS games would be a good thing and could bode well for the game but first and foremost ck3

[/h1]\nThe new culture system is undoubtably a nice addition to the game, adding flavor and giving the player the option to create your own culture. But this feature that some say should have been in the base game already, quickly gets overshadowed by the royal court itself, and it is something special.\n\nThe special thing is that the court is at first glance cool and all but those few events that happen, quickly get repetitive and boring. Not to mention that a late game court is ridiculously expensive and unsustainable for a late game empire. The Throne room feels and seems ackward since it is so out of place. The artifact system they brought back from ck2 also feels this way and these factors break the immersion that has been ck for me. The visuals are nice but definetly not what crusader kings needed. \nWhat it needed was new gameplay additions, for example like they had in ck2 playable republics or more startdates with more character events, flavor for muslims, supernatural events, silkroad, sickness mechanics, crusade mechanics that are actually fun and rewarding for the winner, great project designer, china, horde mechanics, indian flavor, immortality for the absolute chad ruler you are playing, they had all those things and surely many more in ck2, but nothing anyway close this epic in ck3. If you want to experience these things you have to rely on mods.\n\nBut by far my biggest compaint is the fact that, this doesnt add anything new and you'll play the game the same way you did before and the fact that they charge 30 bucks for this which is insane. The first flavor pack in ck3 Northern Lords added many fun and interesting events and options for asatru characters. But this lacks in comparison. This, a major expansion which adds practically nothing gameplaywise, lacks in comparison to a flavor pack that added new gameplay mechanics for a fraction of the price. I would honestly not even recommend to wait for a sale here since the obvious right thing to do would be to return back to playing ck2.\n\n[b] tl;dr RIP 30 bucks for everyone not owning ck3 Royal Edition, go play ck2 instead.

And for what? The extremely mediocre visuals in the Royal Court, regardless of how much effort they took to make, aren't worth the price-tag or the period of time we've had to wait for them. The actual royal court features, as another reviewer has mentioned, really do just feel tacked on (e.g. I don't believe any events that originate outside the royal court screen ever make it  into the royal court; it's just specific, automatically generated royal court events). They don't seem to have justified the direction this DLC has gone in and they don't really seem to change the way I play. I would have been equally happy with an artefact system that was purely abstract without the visuals. The court is also, at this early stage pretty unbalanced in terms of its costs and potential benefits.\n\nI'm a much bigger fan of the cultural changes. More attention should have been directed towards that side of the game. I'd be much more interested in political and ecclesiastical improvements to religions and more role-playing depth in the church; e.g. introducing improved versions of Catholic Investiture, the papacy, anti-papacies, the Byzantine Empire's imperial system. We're 18 months post-launch and we still don't have even CK2's level of realm management/customisation via laws and council voting. We don't even have regencies.\n\nThe modding potential that Royal Court has opened up must be enormous and the game will probably be better for it in the long run, but at launch I really can't say it's worth the price-tag", "timestamp_created": 1644756411, "timestamp_updated": 1644756905, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.731439709663391113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110140991": {"recommendationid": "110140991", "author": {"steamid": "76561198068716055", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Expensive, but I got it as a pre-order bonus.

However it's important to point out that for the current price you're not getting much. \n\nFirst let's start with the positives, the special part about Royal Court is the 3D modelling. The new events that can occur from within your throne room are fun to play through and helps make the game last a bit longer by creating more things to do. Furthermore Royal Court introduces changes to the culture system best described as more dynamic now. Following that is the reintroduction of artifacts and different court positions. So there's a good amount of features within this DLC.\n\nBut on the contrary to this, Royal Court can be a bit lacking in areas. As a player you get to decide how much money you'd like to spend on your court and sadly it doesn't feel like your financial decisions carry much weight as you alternate your spending. Additionally there isn't much you can do inside your throne room besides tending to random events and holding court, even then there isn't much that visually happens within these events either. It doesn't feel as if they're utilizing the full potential of what they created which is a shame.\n\nHowever these are baby steps into new territory. Hopefully Paradox keeps the momentum going and does something impressive with how you handle your court in the future. Until then we can only wait and see\n\nOverall if you like playing CK3 and want to purchase DLC for it, you're better off waiting for Royal Court to go on sale first. If I could pick between 1-10 for this game it'd be a 6.5, the features itself are very nice in concept but in practice needs more polishing.

It's not something I'm ever excited about, and personally feel looks extremely bland, adding very little to the overall experience.\n\nCulture System: This was what I felt was the true meat and potatoes of the expansion, and a revamped culture system is what I've been wanting for a very long time. However does it really add up to the original hype? Not really. The new systems are nice and definitely will make each playthrough more interesting and more diverse, but ultimately it's a very slow-paced system that you can't utilize all too well until mid-late game when you can accumulate a lot of prestige or decide to make random hybrids just to steal peoples innovations (something I don't care to do because it doesn't make sense from an in-game narrative standpoint, and Paradox is really trying to push roleplay so this doesn't make sense). It's great if you're playing a viking though. I think I'm starting to see a trend with Paradox, hmm.\n\nLanguage: What in gods unholy name is this? I don't know if I'm just an idiot who can't figure out the most basic thing but this feels not only completely useless mechanically, but also functionless. Learning other languages doesn't seem to actually do anything productive other than add a slight RP flair, which I don't care for. The idea seems nice but I feel like even if it does have some function that I'm not properly making use of, it's still worthless and adds nothing.\n\nArtifacts: Aight here is the big money. I honestly don't have any real complaints about this, I think they did a pretty solid job on it and it's just CK2's system but infinitely better since it works with the court room. You feel like the things you create and collect actually matter in a way, and sure you can probably break the game with some insanely OP items but honestly that is probably part of the fun, just like in CK2.\n\nMinor Titles: I like this quite a lot. At the end of the day it feels almost as pointless as they were in CK2 but they are in fact, not useless. So that is nice. The buffs you get from most of them aren't really noticeable most of the time, but when you start bringing in the cash it adds some more flavor to your playthrough since they can do some neat stuff. During one of my playthroughs I had my trash diplo viking leading armies and he didn't get hurt once, most likely because my bodyguards were actually doing their job. Perhaps I got lucky, but I like to think the feature was doing its job.\n\nIs It Worth It?: I'm probably forgetting some big things but honestly cba about thinking about it. Overall it may seem like my attitude is quite negative towards the DLC but I enjoy it quite a bit, and it will a lot of fun to each of my playthroughs going forward, and since this is one of my favorite games with about 1000 hours into now, it's worth it for me. So for me it's a no brainer, however this is 1000% overpriced. The amount of content it brings to the table feels on par with Northern Lords in size, but obviously more ambitious. If you are having conflicting thoughts about wanting to get it then you should probably wait for a sale, but if you plan on playing a lot like I do, then it's worth it. It's a shame we waited over a year for just this, but I'm hoping this is just the foundation for bigger plans that Paradox has for CK3s future. I understand that the pandemic slowed things down drastically, and we were supposed to get this ages ago so I don't hold that against Paradox, and always am hoping for the best. \n\nI do hope the DLC pans out well because it would crush me if they canned CK3 like they did with Imperator and many more projects they had in the works. I know it's been a very difficult year for them financially, and part of me is worried this isn't going to help all too much.", "timestamp_created": 1644743456, "timestamp_updated": 1644743456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.71293795108795166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110129647": {"recommendationid": "110129647", "author": {"steamid": "76561198021707500", "num_games_owned": 285, "num_reviews": 25, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "It's full of nothing/ Good job.\nSome people just need to work instead of endlessly complaining about made up harassment nonsense.

All the events are still basically just pop ups, just inside 3D courtroom space, the event where someone becomes your footstool? Your ruler will not have a footstool within the 3D courtroom. the only thing you can add to your courtroom is artifacts which give measly bonuses and you never spend gold on because it isn't worth it, they just stack up over the course of conquering AI. Also one big glaring problem is that if you are tribal or not at least a king in rank, you don't get a court, so easily over 50% of the starting game just doesn't have a 3D court at all... \n\nThe cultural aspect of the game is interesting but at the same time, there seem to be arbitrary caveats as to when you can reform or divulge, like \"Your culture is not at least 100 years old\", why does that matter if I want to start a different culture?  On top of this there are huge hurdles for what seem again like seemingly small buffs for such a vast amount of effort focusing on it.\n\nIn conclusion, its terrible, the fact I waited so long for this and sat through 30 minutes of Paradox's stupid Twitch stream for it to drop makes me want to go back in time and smack myself.

The culture change is good but it does often descend into chaos. Its just clear that the dev team is ignoring their play testers as they often do. The only paradox product that seems to be learning from their dev mistakes is Stellaris, with the open beta that's been going for the past few weeks which is rad. Thank you stellaris dev team for taking a step in the right direction. CK3 team learn from the stellaris devs and provide an open beta to people who pre-purchase the dlc, and listen to the feedback.

The AI also seem to be better since they scheme a lot more and are more aggressive (finally). This pack is intrigue oriented and I have to say I really enjoy it.

Who cares? This is paradox. People are willing to buy hearts of iron 4 dlc for 15 quid, when it should of been in the game in the first place. This is different, this is content that has never been before seen in any crusader king's titles, lets strip this down a bit into parts. The parts will go in order of what a normal player is likely to see to what a hardcore player is going to see.\n\nNormal Player:\nA normal player of this DLC will most likely only scratch the surface, the main bragging points of Royal Court are better cultures, courts with 3D MODELS!!!! And even a little bit of polish sprinkled on top, the first thing I noticed is that the map looks much, much cleaner and the models on the characters are just better somehow. It is hard to describe how great these features are, the less interesting feature (in my opinion) is the inventory system. It brings some very minor bonuses but its pretty cool from a RP standpoint. On a different subject, the RP potential and storytelling this DLC can provide is crazy, I would love to see a Game of Thrones mod with this DLC.\n\nIronman Player:\nFor those unfamiliar with Ironman mode, it does not allow saving and is pretty much considered hardcore mode. You will probably be able to reform, diverge or form a hybrid culture with your culture if you are specifically devoted. This can provide some cool bonuses too like \"Malleable Invaders\" which allows hybrid cultures in your realm to form more easily, and this slots in PERFECTLY with the Northern lords too. I suppose since this is a review I do need to beat up the DLC a little, they left tribal ruler's, dukes and counts out of the Courts of the DLC called \"Royal court\", this can make the expansion feel barebone's early game- Especially if you are going for achievements such as \"Rags to riches\" or \"Mother of us all\" which both start early game and usually in tribal realms. Now don't ask me why, but every game I have so far played has been on Iron Man mode, usually starting in a tribal realm. This expansion can feel non-noticeable at times and that does not bode well with the amount of people shitting themselves over the pirce. \n\nHardcore Players- I don't consider myself a hardcore player, like a 1000 hours reddit moderator kind of person. The closets I have came to that is a near 200 hours, but that's probably just because when I first started playing this game I was engrossed like a child discovering a bottle with a thing that makes it look ever so slightly look like a rocket. \n\nMy Opinion- This DLC is pretty good, I would not go as far to say it is brilliant. But it is moldbreaking in the sense that it gives the player new RP potential and better yet. custom dynasty banners. Many hours were spent making the Amogus banner, or maybe even the banner of house Lannister. But... I don't get why people are taking it in turns to kick paradox to the ground, like, you already gave them a solid blow to the jaw with the review's on \"Northern Lords\" and you all seem to have atleast 100 hours into the game, so suck it up, take it at face value and see what it really is- A cool DLC that adds cultures and 3D models, if this DLC is not for you, then I get that. But please, please don't go bitching about its price.

Nope, only kings and emperors have a place to chill with their courtiers and their vassals just rules from the street, apparently (Fixed by mods) \n\nDo you want to play as an epic jarl why rules from his badass mead hall? Nope, Paradox thinks tribal governments were a bunch of savages with no concept of a court (Fixed by mods) \n\n\"Oh well, they've spent so much time developing this DLC. Surely they must've made a lot of flavour events\" you might think. Nope, there are about 5 events in your court, 10-15 \"hold court\" events and 5-ish world events. (Yet to be fixed by mods) \n\nAll of it can be excused for a rushed DLC.

It's not bad, but the actual content here feels like it amounts to the patch that usually comes along side a major expansion, rather than an expansion itself. The two primary features here are firstly a court which does very little other than act as a money sink and a store room for items that mostly give you slight prestige bonuses. Secondly, it has culture modifications, which are more substantial but don't seem to offer a huge variance in play style. \n\nThe problem with culture is it still hasn't really changed to be more notable from CK2, which is to say that it's almost irrelevant, providing minor or aesthetic changes rather than sweeping playstyle changes. Mercantile seafaring peoples get some extra income on the coast, highland warriors get some slight bonuses to combat in hills etc. The problem with bland bonuses like that is they don't change at all what you'll actually do in your game - Play a religion that has a lay clergy and you can hold temples. Pagans can raid while unreformed. See the difference between how religion is portrayed and how culture is? Culture feels like background fluff even in the places where it does provide benefits because it provides benefits that don't alter how you play. There's a city builder tradition in the game, but it still doesn't enable you to hold cities as a feudal.\n\nEven for hit and miss DLC in CK2, they tended to change how you played substantially. The Horse Lords was a good example - I am one of the few who enjoyed the clan based government even though it was extremely rudimentary. At the very least it was an actual different experience. All of the CK2 governments felt substantially different to play as.\n\nIt does seem like the only reason this has been priced so high is that the court has actual visual representation. All it is at the end of the day is an abstraction of what CK2-3 already had: Events and interactions with other characters. It all seems like a serious overreach for something that doesn't add any new core gameplay experiences. \n\nCK3 doesn't need to be prettier, it needs more in it. The most important things to the game are religions and government types, and unfortunately that hasn't changed, culture still isn't really that important in that mix beyond what it already was. Which makes the choice to ignore expanding the currently limited options regarding government very strange on the part of Paradox as well.", "timestamp_created": 1644661940, "timestamp_updated": 1644661940, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.494604319334030151", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110049391": {"recommendationid": "110049391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198847732541", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5341\u5206\u62c9\u8de8", "timestamp_created": 1644661563, "timestamp_updated": 1644661563, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110049364": {"recommendationid": "110049364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093321572", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "At best this is a culture flavour pack.

The royal court mechanic really makes your realm feel more alive, furthermore it adds more play to your economy, by constantly balancing the  level of court grandeur with the amount of gold you can miss. Furthermore, the new culture mechanic really allows for a more dynamic playstyle, that was previously not possible. The artifact system is a cool addition, however you can get so many useless artifacts that it may be difficult to find the ones that are actually good, it can make this system a bit tedious. Paradox should find a way to fix the sorting systems for artifacts because it does not appear to be working for me.\n\nAll in all I think the dlc itself is a lot of fun and adds many new elements to the game that were previsouly missing.

Look, I love Paradox games, and I consider this DLC essential to the game. So why can't I recommend it? Well it's not JUST the price. It's the fact that they've locked so many basegame features BEHIND such a highly priced DLC. They basically took stuff that was already part of CK2, waited like a year to add it to CK3, and then charged more than 50% of the basegame's price for it. You're not covering any new ground, you're just giving us back features we already have access to from a different game - Other than the 3D rendered royal court, which is cool but very incomplete. You can spend on amenities but nothing visibly changes about your court or courtiers when you get elite fashion or endless servants. When this is on sale for $5 then buy it. No hate toward the workers who made this, just ... The absolute upper limit I'd put on the value of this is $15 which is saying something because it includes what should have been CORE FEATURES of the game ON LAUNCH. The only thing that feels like it should be part of a DLC is the 3D rendered court, which probably took up most of their effort and isn't enough by itself to justify a DLC. The rest is arbitrarily paywalled mechanics you shouldn't have to play the game without. I am seriously concerned about the future updates to CK3 if they intend to keep locking basic features behind DLC paywalls that cost almost as much as the game itself.", "timestamp_created": 1644649587, "timestamp_updated": 1644649587, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110039736": {"recommendationid": "110039736", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988805158", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "i am not impressed with this dlc you can't do anything with it the first 100 years of your game and if you dont play as a kingdom or empire then the main gameplay i locked away.", "timestamp_created": 1644649217, "timestamp_updated": 1644649217, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110039673": {"recommendationid": "110039673", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023724131", "num_games_owned": 200, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't understand the negative reviews.

I really love the RPG aspects of the inventory and the court options. I also really like the interaction with your liege (for example Duchess Matilda with Emperor of HRE).

So, I got the season pass  to get the first couple of DLC for free back when I got the game because I'm too impatient to wait for things to go on sale, and I play Paradox games, I know how this all works. So now that it's come out, it feels like I've gotten this DLC for free. Props to past me. \n\nThe DLC is a blast! It adds a lot of flavor and variety, and just a lot more roleplaying and personality to the characters in the game. After several failed attempts I was able to re-enact the Norman Conquest and go about making London home to the grandest royal court in the world. Grand courts give a lot of positive modifiers, including to people's willingness to be recruited to your court, which gives a nice reliable way to invite talented people into your kingdom beyond marrying them in. \n\nCollecting artifacts is great fun, and balancing how much to spend on investing in your realm the old fashioned way versus getting nice new tapestries to hang up in your hall is pretty engaging. Some of the items you get are really powerful, especially in boosting prowess. With some famed armor and a famed weapon you're looking at well over +9 prowess, which you can pass down to your inbred fragile heirs to keep them alive. You can also gift artifacts to those clouts who hooked their way into your council, potentially buffing their doomed lines into some semblance of sentience. It's nice to see the nepotism of the medieval ages develop a couple of pros to balance the many many cons. \n\nThe biggest criticism I have of the DLC is that I'd love to see more. I want to see more types of throne rooms, including a grand wooden feasting hall for tribals and norse Kingdoms. I want to see Empire titles unlock even more court positions and new mechanics in the same way reaching Kingdom opens up the court. I want more room to display my artifacts, I want more banners on the walls, an even larger court, more rooms to visit like the prisons and a treasury. Heck, medieval courts (especially pre 1066) often traveled, I'd love to be able to have more than one royal court, let me set up and decorate a winter palace separately from my summer palace, etc. The UI for gifting artifacts could and should also be improved.\n\nThat said, Royal Courts stands as an exciting addition to the game which adds a LOT of fresh content. Holding court is blast, the new events are great, commissioning artifacts is addictive. If you want to continue to support a gem of a game and have fun doing so, buy the DLC. If you can't afford it, wait for a sale, but this is definitely one you'll want to pick up at some point.

Making it boring and pointless. \n\nOn launch are insane bugs, such as invincible AI armies, regular crashes, save file corruptions, AI getting stuck in endless wars etc. etc.\n\nYou can tell that not only did they not test the game properly, they have actually not played the game to see if their mechanics are even viable.

Holding court just gives you 3-4 decision events that cause little effects to your wider realm and at times feel sloppily thrown together. I once had a count requesting vassalage under me and then the very next person, happens to be his kid brother requesting me to declare war on my new vassal and place him as count. Then after that, you gotta wait for another 5 years for another 4 events. You get 21 new courts positions, but if you go into your court the max amount of people you really see are 10 randos middling about. \nThe relic system also feel mediocre. In your court you are allowed only 3 Banners, 3 small trophy, 3 furniture and 4 centerpieces with only two distinct types of relics, court and personal (which you can equip). You can turn your personal relic into a court relic but not the other way around. So if you want to wear the Crown of Justinian as you lead your empire, you can't because its only purpose is to be on display in 1 of 4(!!!!) slots in your court. So as a large empire with 20 plus relics, you're really not displaying the power and majesty of your court and more showing off a bit of nick knacks to your house guests.

I don't want to say that I don't recommend this, because I did enjoy this expansion. But at the same time, it doesn't feel right to recommend it in it's current state/pricing.\nI'll summarise: \n\n1. Is it fun? - Yeah, adding actual 3D spaces to see your characters in gives the world a more 'lived in' feel. I', very curious to see how they would expand on this in future, adding more 'scenes' as it were e.g. banquet hall, battle fields, council chambers etc..\nThat being said, I personally feel that the real 'meat' of this expansion has nothing to do with the Royal Court itself, but rather the much requested culture rework. Also seems weird to exclude tribal rulers from having a court. You wanna tell me Genghis Khan didn't have a court? And why is there no native freecam option? I wanna see my grossly inbred King's face up close dammit!\n\n2. Was it worth waiting for? - Depends on how long you were waiting for it. If you count from when they started selling the 'Royal Edition' prior to the base release that's almost two years. Obviously Covid threw a wrench into everything, but even so, I don't think the amount of content added by this DLC justifies how long people have had to wait for it. This is something that absolutely cannot be repeated by Paradox.\n\n3. Is it worth the price? - LOL NO. See above. This is the most expensive DLC Paradox have ever released. Hell I got this through the Royal Edition and I feel a little shortchanged by it. Just wait until it goes on sale.

On the one hand if you only add features already present in the prequel, people are miffed to be paying for the same features all over again. But if you only add completely new features people will start complaining about your priorities and form factions to demand their favourite feature be added to the game right now.\nTo circumvent this problem Paradox decided on a compromise for Royal Court, adding a completely new dynamic culture system, a 3D throne room, and reintroducing a fan favourite: artifacts.\nRoyal Court is considered the first major DLC for Crusader Kings 3, with a grand price tag of $30. This sets the bar high for Royal Court. To meet expectations, it must try to be more ambitious than any CK2 DLC ever was. Let\u2019s see if it succeeds at this.\n\n[b] Culture system [/b]\nAt launch Crusader Kings 3 distinguished itself from its predecessors by having a dynamic faith system. It not only had more religions, but also allowed players to start their own religion, greatly improving replay value and the RPG potential of the game.\nWith Royal Court a similar system is implemented for culture. Cultures are no longer one-dimensional but consist of various cultural pillars. Players and AI can now reform these pillars over time. Most significant of these pillars are the traditions. A culture can have up to 5 traditions at game start and there is a large amount of them in the game giving access to a variety of bonusses and mechanics. Most traditions are meaningful, and a well customized culture can greatly help lean into a certain playstyle.\nReforming a culture is not the only way cultures change in the new system. There is also the possibility of diverging from your culture. Diverging a culture is instantaneous and allows for faster customization if prestige is plentiful. As such it does lack the long-term planning that comes with reforming a culture. A third option is hybridizing, merging two cultures. Like diverging, hybridization is instantaneous, but does require some long-term planning as certain amount of cultural acceptance is needed before hybridization is possible.\nWith the added complexity of languages, ethoses and traditions to culture and with the addition of three ways to dynamically change cultures, Royal Court adds a lot of content and greatly increases the replayability. With this new culture system Royal Court proves it is willing to take an ambitious leap and back it up with quite the amount of content.\n\n[b] Royal Courts [/b]\nAlso new with this DLC is its namesake, the royal court, visualized as a 3D throne room filled with courtiers. This space is used to stage some events in and represent the state of your court, abstracted to a value called grandeur. Grandeur can range from 0 to 100 and is mostly decided by your willingness to spend money on it, either through amenities or hiring people to fill court positions. Because money is relatively easy to come by in CK3, grandeur isn\u2019t hard to max out. Because of this and the fact that an increase in grandeur only results in bonusses, there isn\u2019t really any trade-off to grandeur and doesn\u2019t present the player with any meaningful choice.\nThe virtual throne room looks visually stunning and does succeed in making the court feel more alive, expanding the RPG aspect of CK3 further. The court is however only visible in a window separate from the map where players will spend most of their time. To counter this the developers added events that pop-up in this window and the decision to hold court that present the player with a string of events, but players might find they still only occasionally check the court window.\nWith the addition of the royal court the developers take a risk by adding something very few people requested. It\u2019s an ambitious step to utilize Clausewitz 2\u2019s 3D capacity and elevate the game\u2019s role-playing capabilities. But because players will only spend a limited time in the virtual court, there is only just enough content to justify it as a feature. Hopefully future DLC and patches will expand on this feature and give the player more stuff to do at court.\n\n[b] Artifacts [/b]\nOne thing visible in your court not mentioned yet are artifacts. A first for Crusader Kings, artifacts actually show up as 3D models when added to a court. The virtual court is however not the only place artifacts might be collected. Characters also have a personal inventory, where artifacts that can be carried on their person are represented. Artefacts are primarily acquired via inspired characters, who can be sponsored to start crafting items, and there is an assortment of events that determine the outcome of the crafting process.\nThe total number and variety of artifacts added in Royal Court match those of CK2, even though CK2 needed multiple DLC to get to the same amount. This quantity of artifacts shows Royal Court is willing to go the extra mile to catch up and possibly even overtake CK2 DLC content.\n\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\nHaving reviewed all this, we return to the question of if Royal Court adds more content than any of CK2\u2019s DLC did, as its price tag seems to indicate. The answer to that question could be yes, especially when considering the amount of 3D models included in this DLC. Though the amount features added is limited, the culture system and artifacts especially are supported by an impressive amount of content.\nDoes this mean that $30 is a reasonable price to pay for Royal Court? That is a question only you can answer and one which heavily depends on your interest in the included features. It is undoubtedly a hefty sum to pay for a DLC, but if any Crusader King DLC is worth $30, it is Royal Court.\nOne important caveat is that this DLC does focus quite strongly on feudal kings and emperors and forgets about vassals and tribal rulers. While playing as a tribal or vassal can be just as interesting as playing a feudal king, Royal Court barely expands gameplay for these particular playstyles as they do not have access to courts or court artifacts.", "timestamp_created": 1644607887, "timestamp_updated": 1644607887, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481481492519378662", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110001271": {"recommendationid": "110001271", "author": {"steamid": "76561197992861786", "num_games_owned": 489, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Blackmailing is broken in my game; I'm stuck until Paradox fixes it:  https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/spmopg/is_this_a_bug_or_am_i_doing_something_wrong/", "timestamp_created": 1644607756, "timestamp_updated": 1644607756, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "110001161": {"recommendationid": "110001161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002383187", "num_games_owned": 173, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "30 Euros for fluff content that adds very little to the gameplay.

But is it a good DLC? I think it is, and adds to the game along with the free patch. The quality is there, and judging from all the reviews a lot of people purchased it spite of the price. Did you really think any DLC is going to be worth this price? I knew it would not, but I bought it anyway. Why? well because CK3 is awesome and I love playing it so anything that makes it better is great. Complaining about the price means nothing if you bought it as Paradox will not drop the price anytime soon and if you don't buy it then you are stuck waiting 6 month until they do. Paradox knows it is a very popular game and the hardcore fans will pay regardless (we are hooked LOL). Sure it's worth about $15 tops, so if you want to wait then wait. I personally have spent almost twice as much on meals that last an hour and they are  done. I would rather skip the takeout for 1 week and enjoy this game.  Like others have said before, if you are sinking more than 100 hours + on a game that you really enjoy, is dropping $20 to $30 every 6 months really a bad thing? C'mon! the free workshop creations that you can download that are are possible with new DLCs is worth it alone. If you enjoy CK3 why wait? Possibly Paradox will learn and listen but if you worked hard on something and sold it at a premium because it was in high demand would you not do the same?

However, for what is on offer here, I find the price that it's at to be too high, mainly because I want more out of $30. However, I think this is the point. \n\nIf you go and check the price of the season pass, at the time of writing this, it is about $35 before any discounts. It's going to be worth watching the price of that season pass, because if it goes up by the time I'm writing this, then Paradox may be trying to get people to buy a more expensive season pass in order to get a little extra out of customers before any other dlc/flavor-pack/whatever get's released in the first place. The pass was $35 before royal court or northern lords ever came out, and if it goes up, then, to me, it's confirmed that they're trying to prey on people who think, \"yea, the season pass is more expensive, but it means I'll get access to future updates and not get left behind with something that is overpriced.\"\n\nTo sum it up, if you REALLY want this dlc now, get the season pass. If you are willing to wait for sales, then please do so, and if the price of that season pass DOES go up, then, Paradox, that seems like a really slimy marketing strategy. \n\nLooking back at it now, that might be why Northern Lords is $15 dollars as well.\n\nEDIT: Northern Lords isn't $15.

I feel like people are not truly appreciating how big of a deal the 3D throne room is. I have been dreaming of something that added exactly this since release of CK2. Adds the final level of immersion that gets you lost in your sandbox world, cultures and characters feel way more dynamic and well real.\n\nAs it stands, even with the price tag, personally I think it add a lot of flavour, suddenly characters come alive with the court and the events seem way more natural and memorable since you trigger certain events from your court, outside of holding court. Haven\u2019t had a lot of time to fully flesh it out but it seems to run well and provide a lot unique artefact events as well as other unseen possibilities.\n\nThe only cons I see are it is limited the royal court to only kings and emperors, also you need to be feudal so a big chunk of the map doesn\u2019t really benefit and I personally prefer being a dukedom or duke under a king, at least to start. But I imagine this will get added later on with DLCs probably and more flavour packs.\n\nIf you play Paradox games you know what to expect. In the end this is one of the better DLCs I\u2019ve ever bought from them. For sure a lot of mechanics and flavour that add a lot to the game, expensive but if you have the cash and are eager to game, I think it is worthwhile. It won\u2019t break your game or anything strange. \n\nI felt the strong need to add a positive comment because I am tired of seeing the toxic and angry part of the Paradox community just downvote released like mad just because it is expensive or they don't think it is enough. The answer is simple enough for people who don't like what the company is doing, just stop buying the game or what for a sale. But stop just spamming downvotes because you don't like the DLC model.

It was delayed for stability and I am fine with that however I guess it should have been delayed a bit longer. I can not play a game for more than 20 minutes with out one of the following happening; Game stops responding, Crash report window pops up, Computer freezing, or my favorite BSOD. At first my crash reports tried to do the very best they could but after submitting around 20 they may have devolved into \"Trying to play the game.\"\n\nNow for the price, this game costs more than half the base game and as such I expected a fair transformative product. However even if we take into account the free update [which I am not since most of it is there to support the paid content] this is not worth the price. I did not play CK2 but from what I have gathered they are adding back functionality from a previous title slowly. But honestly aside from the court positions that are part of the free game I don't think there is much here. \n\nI was gifted the DLC for my birthday since it came out a day before and I feel like the person that bought it for me got robbed That is how wholly inadequate I think this product is for the price. It is probably more at home at around 12.99 but it is hard to justify any more than that.\n\nPerhaps my opinion will change in the future, infact I hope it does.

Paradox developers have noted the challenges of dealing with COVID-19 and working from home arrangements, but their decline in quality and the overpricing of DLC begins as early as EU4's The Cossacks (for which I wrote a very lengthy negative review, hence why I specifically remember it), released nearly 7 years ago at the end of 2015. COVID-19 is not the problem.\n\nAt pain of making this review far longer, I could continue on about my speculations regarding Paradox Development Studios and how it's operated, and why this is causing problems. But reviews have a character limit, so I will reserve my remarks on PDS to this: STRATEGISE your time better, re-evulate how you value features, do not assume more time = more value.\n\n[b]The DLC's added content: is it good?[/b]\n\nIt's just... okay. You couldn't say the content is 'awful'; the added depth to cultures is a welcome addition, the inventory and combat systems something I missed from CK2 and glad to have back, and the new royal court and its many new positions fairly mediocre but not [i]awful[/i] features.\n\nIs the new content enjoyable, though? Not really. Not that it has made the game less enjoyable, but I can't say it has made the game more enjoyable either. The way I play CK3 hasn't really changed from before Royal Court. The features, though not awful, feel  \"tacked on\". They don't offer new ways to play, but merely supplement the existing gameplay loop. Aside from needing to keep your court's grandeur above the expected threshold, you could validly completely ignore your royal court and it would make no serious impact upon gameplay.\n\nEngaging with your royal court also becomes quite tedious. I was surprised to find after checking CK3's Royal Court event files that there are 86 (as I counted) general royal court events, yet while playing it feels as though there are only 10-15. The issue is that many events rely upon specific conditions that are unlikely to change throughout a character's life. Many, for example, rely upon certain court positions being occupied, but as a vast majority of them cost 0.50 to 1.50 gold to upkeep, it is simply too expensive to have more than a handful of courtiers employed at any given time until the late game (by which time, given how easy CK3 is, most have stopped playing out of boredom). Consequently, you are faced with the same set of events again and again.\n\nI'd also note that it [i]seems[/i] a majority of court events are negative, usually resulting in you losing money, prestige, and relations with one or more vassals. Positive outcomes are rare and not rewarding enough when holding court more often leads to negative outcomes. Events where gold is lost is especially harsh when your court grandeur threshold requires dedicating almost your entire income to court amenities.\n\nAnd, on that note, the cost of court amenities and salaries scale awfully. Tying court costs to eras results in expense hikes completely disconnected from the pacing of the game. Income game design has been made to grow gradually as you invest in buildings and increase county development over time, but the +25% hike in court costs is instantaneous upon entering a new era. To use my current game starting as West Francia as an example, I formed the empire of Francia and rule over essentially eight de jure kingdoms. This makes my court grandeur expectation level 10, meaning I essentially need full court amenities. Going from Tribal to Early Medieval instantly increased my court amenities cost by 10 gold and made many of the court positions I had filled no longer affordable to maintain as their salaries also hiked by +25%.\n\nThis meant I needed to make many court positions vacant, meaning less interaction with courtiers and less event flavour, as well as it disrupting the flow of gameplay completely as I had to suddenly shift towards buildings and development all of a sudden without any graduality- a shift that is hard to do, given its reliance on stable income and time. I don't feel as though this janky kind of gameplay is the kind of gameplay intended, especially given how disjointed it is from CK3's game design approach to income.\n\nFinal issue I have with the royal court is the royal court view itself. Court artefacts, especially pedestal artefacts, look awkwardly out of place. After filling out all the artefact slots, your court more resembles a museum storeroom than it does a royal court. It begs the question why this feature was even implemented when it really serves no purpose.\n\nI recall reading in a dev diary that a significant amount of coding went into adapting the engine so that the royal court could be visually represented. [i]Why?[/i] Several times in the past (after repeated controversies around pricing) Paradox has justified the price of their DLCs upon the time and effort they invested into developing them. The issue with such an approach is obvious: consumers don't value time and effort, they value quality and content.\n\nAccounting for how feature-poor this [i]very expensive[/i] DLC is, I can't help but feel Paradox felt justified in their pricing due to the time they poured into coding and troubleshooting the engine to support the court visuals. Not only are these visuals very [i]average[/i] and completely lacking responsive variation (why doesn't my court change when I pour money into luxury amenities? why doesn't it look like a rundown shelter when I neglect it?), it serves zero gameplay function. Here, I believe, Paradox made a HUGE misjudgement, placing far too much value in the visuals.\n\nCK3 is a [i]grand strategy game[/i]. While the visual representation of characters is highly appropriate for CK3's core gameplay, it being centred around the lives of individuals, it was unnecessary to extend that as far as visually representing the royal court, especially when doing so was so costly and needing further development of an already greatly functional engine. Frankly, it was a complete waste of time and money.\n\nI think most players would have been equally as satisfied with simply a flat interface similar to the inventory system that represented the artefacts on display in their court, not needing the extensive effort that was invested into showcasing those artefacts visually. Interacting with characters in this interface is a hopeless affair. It has never been helpful and I continue to use either the council panel or courtiers panel. In fact, more often it becomes an inconvenience, as the intuitive and fantastic tooltip system CK3 introduced to Paradox's games doesn't work as fluidly with the royal court interface, it blocking the display of panels and requiring me to exit the court view during court events to check a character's aptitude for court positions they're requesting, or to check titles relevant to a court event as the title panel is also completely blocked when in the royal court view.\n\nI believe the crux of this DLC's issue lies in the decision to have the royal court visualisation. If all the time and effort that went into implementing new engine code instead was dedicated to new mechanics, interactions, and flavour, there is no doubt this DLC would have been better received. The fact that the Northern Lords flavour pack actually changed the gameplay loop by offering new ways to play by varying choices and interactions, while this mainline major expansion fails to do so and sits more as an idle supplement and less a game changing major expansion, says a lot to how significantly those who direct Paradox's projects misunderstand what makes their games fun, engaging, and replayable.\n\nParadox Development Studios HAS talented staff, capable of making quality products, but I believe PDS's management of time and valuation of features is deeply flawed. They MUST improve their strategy.

You're basically getting half the DLC content for free, but you can pay for the *full* thing (including the free content) if you want it. It helps to fund the continued development of the game, which allows Paradox to continue to support their games for as long as they do.\n\nPlus, if you have a group of friends you play with consistently, only one of you (the host) needs to own the DLC.\n\nWith that out of the way,\n\nPOSITIVES\n- fits seamlessly into the standard CK3 gameloop and doesn't feel like a gimicky add-on\n- seeing the characters in court and interacting with them brings them to life and makes you care about them a lot more\n- gives you more to do during down-time and adds a lot of flavour to the game, which was sorely needed\n- very pretty 3D models\n\nNEGATIVES\n- at present the artifacts system, which is a base game feature but featured most prominently in the expansion, focuses too much on generic and low-level items, and artifact bloat is even worse than in Crusader Kings II\n- some minor issues with polish and bugs, particularly in loc texts which has some spelling and grammar issues, though we can expect these to be fixed with time\n", "timestamp_created": 1644548660, "timestamp_updated": 1644548660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502685487270355225", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109958347": {"recommendationid": "109958347", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997435687", "num_games_owned": 463, "num_reviews": 76, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "After so many failed expansions I was finally having hope for a return to form, but I'm once again bitterly disappointed.

It's not a bad DLC at all, but it's not what was promised. We were promised a completely game changing experience and it's not that. The reason I bought it was, mostly because I know Paradox. The free updates are never really worth it without the dlc, lots of cool buttons left unclickable until you buy something. Wanting to see exactly what this cool new 3D court system was. And man am I underwhelmed. Again, it's not a bad DLC at all. It adds cool things, and some useless. Like the language. It doesn't matter. Languages don't matter at all unfortunately. It would be a really cool addition if it wasn't so hyped up. We had to wait extra time due to covid, and that's okay I understand that. We saw what working from home did to CyberPunk 2077, without the ability for devs to test the games on consoles. So I don't mind  that it took a while. But it's just not game changing. It isn't what was promised. I think most of the time went to designing everything in 3D and making sure it worked, and nothing really interesting was added. This isn't worth $30. It isn't worth $30 at all. I would say it's barely worth $15. Paradox has entire games that cost less than this, let alone better DLC's that cost less. Don't do what I did. Don't get caught up thinking you need it for the better game experience. And don't get caught up in the hype the YouTubers are giving this DLC. \n\nIs it good? Yes.\nIs it what was promised?

(The mods are also high quality, just look through the Crusader Kings 3 Twitter Feed)\n\nCons:\n- Can feel a little extra spammy with pop-ups at times\n- The 'Hold Court' Interaction and Random Court Interactions sometimes feel pointless, tedious and may take more away than it gives.\n\nPeople need to chill with their ranting about the price-tag.\nThis DLC changes your entire game, and it comes with a free major update for anyone less interested.\nAll cultures are changed with new systems, fundamentals and progressions, which changes the flow of your -entire- playthrough. \nThey did it in a good way too, that adds depth but doesn't make it tedious. \nThe artifacts are nice rounded system, which if you truly dig into, can boost and bolster your entire empire to almost overpowered extremes. \n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n- Change the court scene in an Empire, so that it doesn't just appear as a Kingdom Court\n- More customizations options for the court itself, so that we may make it a bit more personal (beyond artifact showcases)\n- Balance the 'Dual for Artifact' interaction, can't believe a 40 prowess absolute mountain of a man can lose to a 91 year old granny\n- Reduce the amount of random cultural divergences happening, as it gets quite overwhelming\n- Generally reduce the spread of random cultures and hybrid cultures everywhere, as it feels as though you can't even hope to have an empire of the same culture anymore.\n- Make more options to interact with the new court positions (Jester, Bodyguard, etc.) as currently it's almost always the same random prompts you get.\n\nOverall, I recommend this DLC even at it's price-point.

Now they released this single expansion at the price of 30 euros, which makes it the most expensive PDS dlc ever. Their main excuse for the increased pricepoint was that the expansions for CK3 would be massive and gamechanging, however, RC adds barely enough content to be priced at 20 euros (like holy fury for CK2), I would even say that 15 is a more suitable price. Most of their development efforts were spent on making the court itself, which left the expansion lacking in substance in regards to mechanics, pretty graphics is not content.\n\nThis expansion makes me worry that the decision to go 3D for CK3 was a bad one, as it maimed their development time by forcing to allocate resources to make the 3D models work. If their following expansions are also gonna take so long to release and will spend so much effort on graphics over new game mechanics - CK3 will never reach it's true potential.\n\nIf the expansion arrived 6 months sooner and was priced at 15-20 euros, most of the complaints would be gone.

Wie die Anzahl der m\u00f6glichen Events, die M\u00f6glichkeit auch als Herzog einen solchen Hof zu haben oder auch der ein und andere Bug. Potential gibt es massenweise und ich bin mir sicher das Paradox mich da in Zukunft nicht entt\u00e4uschen wird. \nDarum will ich die Entwickler unbedingt weiterhin unterst\u00fctzen, sodass es sich f\u00fcr sie auch rentiert weiter an dem DLC zu arbeiten.", "timestamp_created": 1644510022, "timestamp_updated": 1644510022, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526372730731964111", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109930903": {"recommendationid": "109930903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198377536719", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The majority of the down votes are from people complaining about the price of the DLC which is valid enough, however it does add more than enough content to overhaul the game completely.

Now you need to consider a lot more of pros and cons of which culture you belong to. I like it better than the separated systems from ck2, and I hope to see it causes the world to be more diverse, on top of the diversity of government type and religion. \n\nInventory system is a good, and a good foundation for mods and stuff to come.\nNot so pleased with the court UI, holding court, hiring artisans and setting displays in the court itself is a lot of repetitive clicking, but can be improved as feedback checks in. Many good new events in the court, many dependant on two AI characters internal relations so now you have more reason to get to know your vassals not only in relation to you, but between themselves.I hope they dont become too repetive. \n\nI do get why the lower noble titles dont get a full court, it is better this way, it keeps the new options reserved for greater powers, instead of watering it down to be accessible to some degree for all. Also, it is not \"locked\", you are just expected to take part in your lieges court instead, and there is plenty to gain from it. \n\nI dont like that more actions are put into the existing advisors roles. Especially the steward has way too many important tasks to do, and he can't split his attention, instead has to focus 100% on one out of many important tasks.  I might not have encountered a \"passive\" cultural shift mechanic yet, but I feel it could be needed, unless the steward unloads to some jobs to other advisors.  \n\nIt is fair for people to critizise the price, but I am a big fan of starting out with dedicating DLC to developing strong foundations for core mechanics, and this is important for the main game but also for modding. There is much work put into this, culture is huugely important, and is not at a scale similar to the new religion system which is also a great foundation for many years of modding and expansions. New \"content\" like government types and regional content can come along the way. Maybe if the developers helped us understand the minor new features better, like \"700 new dialogues\" alongside \"inventory system\" it would help people understand what they are paying for. It takes time to encounter it all, yet here we are giving thumps up and down within 24 hours of release. \n\nNow there is a lot to do as kings and empires.

And boy, what a let down it is. Seriously, what is this? Visually, looks as bad as in the development diary pictures. Awkward few second animation loops or completely static characters. Functionally pointless. The court grandeur is just a punitive system (get to a certain level by spending gold to avoid punishments) with limited benefits (good to know that as Emperor people are now more willing to accept my children for tutoring...) Events are meh, 3 petitioners asking for random stuff, usually money or court appointment. But they don't even play out in court, it is still a textbox. The thrown-together \"adult\" visual novels that flood the new release page of steam have more visual interactivity than the royal court. Most of the time it is easy to forget that there is even a royal court, so disconnected it is from everything else: it is basically a completely self-contained subsystem because somebody at Paradox just doesn't understand that I did not want a dollhouse to display their mediocre 3D assets.\n\nUltimately does Royal Court make the game better? Not really, its additions are disconnected and have very limited affect on how the game is played. Does it make it worse? Kind of, royal courts are just a massive resource sink, court positions are convoluted, and culture now overlaps with religion in weird ways. What the DLC definitely does is put a nail in the coffin of any hope that Paradox can or is interested in delivering major additions to the underlying game.\n\nI had this nagging feeling throughout the dev diaries and the whole game that royal court was some developer's gf/bf idea and they were very proud of it, so the dev had to put it into the game or sleep on the couch. How divorced royal court is from what the game actually needs (better economy, better warfare, better alliances, better diplomacy, etc.) it is as good an explanation as any.\n\n                                                                     *****\n\nThere is just nothing major here: the cultural mechanics only imparts small differences and are pretty safe to ignore. Artifacts are ok, but it is not a major mechanical addition.\n\nThe most egregious thing is that after all this wait, half the people won't even get the courtroom or have to wait hundreds of years to do so. The idea that it would not be available for tribal leaders is just  ridiculous: playing as Hungary (one of the recommended starts) it takes centuries to become feudal because of the way that progression is set up. One can have an empire level title but still can't hold court? After 18 hours of play, the key selling feature of the DLC is still unavailable to my non-feudal empire. By the time I will eventually get to it, I doubt I will care at all. It is such a weird decision, it fits into the generally questionable mindset of Paradox perfectly.\n\nOverall, it was a lot of build-up for a decisive dud. After all the anticipation, the DLC is thoroughly forgettable and is not a major addition to the game. Other Paradox games delivered a lot more for/with a lot less. Waiting almost an entire year with no content for this is just a let-down. This is the kind of DLC one would expect at the end of a game's life cycle: minor fluff to fill out some gaps, none that is essential to make the game better. As first DLC (and after all the hype) one could reasonably expect something significantly grander than this.\n\nCoat of Arms designer is good, but it should have been a base game feature.\n\nAlso, not sure whether it is a DLC or Mod issue, but suddenly everyone is wearing turbans and random clothing which is both jarring and slightly amusing.\n\nThis feels like they delivered it to fulfil the DLC promise with as little work as possible either (a) saving anything more substantial for future paid DLC that will be out of the season pass most of the community got or (b) to sunset development on the game. How inconsequential the whole thing is, it really feels like an obligation they wanted to get out of, rather than any form of passion for developing the DLC.\n\nA strong meh out of 10. Worth the wait? No. Worth the money? No. Would I buy it if I didn't already own it? No. So much about taking longer time to deliver larger DLC I guess. The way this cursed industry is going, I guess I should be thankful that the artefacts are not NFTs.", "timestamp_created": 1644501410, "timestamp_updated": 1645142816, "voted_up": false, "votes_up":

It'd be better if it wouldn't scream at you with notifications but rather your Antiquarian did it automatically (maybe with a higher wage, or it cost you more monthly). \n\nThe new roles at court are cool, it definitely gives a better role-play aspect which makes the game more enjoyable. I also had hoped for more cosmetics as the title \"Royal Court\" suggests new additions to the ruler's aesthetic as well as the court's aesthetic.\n\nMerging cultures was something I was looking forward to, I was desperately trying to merge cultures but after about 7 hours I realised it won't benefit my culture in anyway.

It does not seems to have yet the impact on the game play I would have expected but I accept that I may have expected too much and maybe the impact should not be that severe.\nTraditions etc are maybe interesting but seem to me more an endgame feature as the requirements to be able make any changes (prestige) are very high. So until now I have not used it.\nThe one thing I really do not understand at all is that the \"throne room\" or \"royal court\" is not available to tribe based governments. There is no real logical reason for that. I am currently the King of Ireland and also holding about a third of England and Wales. But as I am still tribal I can not access the royal court. Do the developers think that a ruler on \"king\" level would not have decided on disputes or tried to display grandeur only because they were still in a tribal environment ? Even if only located in a long house or larger \"hut\" they would have. I just do not see the need for this restriction or even historical relevance if you like. So at the moment someone who likes to play on tribal level misses out on about half of the extension.\nOn another note, I do have the feeling that a few bugs have been introduced into the game that I have never encountered before. I went to battle with about 8000 men against 2500. The quality of the troops were even. I was winning and the opponent was down to about 400 men when suddenly the battle window shuts down and I was declared the looser of the battle with my about 6000 remaining troops running away from the 400 of my opponent. This happened all in all three times, but only after the royal court release. Also I \"swayed\" another character. I was successful, but instead of the relationship improving the character disliked me for 25 points more rather than less. Again this has not happened before since I have been playing the game (since its release). This looks a bit like a pattern, ie a minus sign in the wrong place of the code. \n\nThe AI of allied troops still is really really bad. There seems to be no logic. Together with my allies I outnumber the enemy by 2:1 but my allies are standing around next to me not engaging while I get slaughtered. And it is even their war not mine ! \nAnyway this is something that has been around from the beginning... sigh.\n\nAll in all, not what I expected. Even taking covid into account it seems that it took too long to get out. I can not get away from the feeling that maybe the developers were starting off with features that sometime down the line proved difficult or even impossible to implement. Potentially part of the additions they wanted to introduce were scrapped or watered down in order to be able to release the extension at all. With this in mind I could see that covid may have had a real impact here. Especially in the design phase of a software project sketchy communication can bring about that the project goes down a rabbit hole and ends up in a dead end. Something that under normal circumstances would have been detected a lot earlier. To recover from that is difficult. \nAnyway, so all in all not great. I would hope that the developers use the fact that a lot of people are disappointed as a pointer and resolve any bugs asap and remove the arbitrary restriction of the throne room.\nSo my 'no' recommendation is to make sure that the developers take note that things are not as they should be or could have been.\n", "timestamp_created": 1644491759, "timestamp_updated": 1644491759, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532351255416870117", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109916328": {"recommendationid": "109916328", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162808539", "num_games_owned": 457, "num_reviews": 103, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u53d1\u552e\u4e4b\u540e\u5c31\u8feb\u4e0d\u53ca\u5f85\u5730\u73a9\u513f\u4e00\u5929 \n\u8fd9\u4e2aDLC\u52a0\u4e86\n1.\u5bab\u6bbf\u91cc\u7684\u573a\u666f,\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u53ec\u89c1\u6709\u6c42\u4e8e\u4f60\u7684\u6c11\u4f17\u548c\u5c5e\u4e0b,\n\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\u8c03\u8282\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u7ea0\u7eb7,\u89e3\u51b3\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42.\n2.\u8fd8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5b9d\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf,\u53ef\u4ee5\u9020\u70b9\u513f\u5251\u65a7\u5b50\u9524\u5b50\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u4e1c\u897f,\u4f46\u662f\u9020\u597d\u4e86\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u671f\u82b1\u94b1\u7ef4\u62a4\n\u611f\u89c9\u4e0d\u5982CK2\u91cc\u7684\u5b9d\u7269\u90a3\u4e48\u9006\u5929\u4e86\n3.\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u65d7\u5e1c,\u5bb6\u65cf\u7eb9\u7ae0\u7684\u529f\u80fd,\u5176\u5b9e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u65e9\u5c31\u8be5\u51fa\u4e86\n4.\u8ffd\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u5927\u5806\u5c0f\u5b98\u804c,\u53c2\u52a0CK2\u91cc\n5.\u8ffd\u7a76\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u7edf \u53ef\u4ee5\u9e66\u9e49\u5b66\u820c\u5b66\u522b\u7684\u6587\u5316\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u589e\u52a0\u597d\u611f \n6.\u6587\u5316\u90e8\u5206\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u52a0\u5f3a,\u5404\u4e2a\u6587\u5316\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u53ef\u4ee5\u82b1\u70b9\u6570\u6539\u53d8,\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u80fd\u878d\u5408\u6587\u5316,\u6311\u53d6\u5404\u4e2a\u6587\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\n\u603b\u7684\u6765\u8bf4\u5e94\u8be5\u7ed9\u597d\u8bc4,\u867d\u713690\u5757\u94b1\u6709\u70b9\u513f\u8d35", "timestamp_created": 1644491738, "timestamp_updated": 1644491738, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109916212": {"recommendationid": "109916212", "author": {"steamid": "76561198980979255", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "i got the whole game for 30 \u20ac, and all the dlc was included.

For some reason this DLC, while adding not much in terms of content (and it is still far worse in quality than certain mods on Steam Workshop), Paradox put a 30$ price tag on this.  \n\nOnly feudal kings and emperors can hold court, so people like me, who like to start from a single county, can't enjoy the new mechanics until you get to the \"king\" status. It is weird. \n\nFor me, CK3 is more about roleplaying and while this DLC claims to be focusing on roleplaying aspect of the game (more events, artifacts, and so on), it's not available from the start of the game and I personally think that's the problem. You, as the player, should be able to have \"Court\" as any lord of any tier, starting from count or tribal or whatever. Counts and Dukes had their own courts and at some points of history, those courts could be more grandeur than that of their liege's. And it most certainly would've improved the roleplay aspect of the game, cause you have these interactions and the progression of your court (from rags to riches) from the start of the game. (Remember the societies in CK2? Now imagine them locked behind duke tier or Learning stat or something like that) Like, we have events in the game where you, as a Viking lord, deal with disputes and stuff on ting-meets, but the \"Court\" mechanic is unavailable for you.  Who thought that was a good idea?\n\nArtifacts are cool, nothing bad to say about them, except it would be nice, again, to have MORE control of your narrative. When I order a weapon to be made for my Viking king, I want it to be an axe, since he's an \"axe expert\" as was stated in the event. Instead, I have a 33% chance to make an axe, war hammer, mace, and else. Like, why can't I choose to make an axe, war hammer or mace is beyond me, apparently kings paid in advance for a cat in a bag. \n\nThe Court Room 3D screen is nice, but again, you can't change the looks of the room, you just have some slots for court artifacts to put into, that's it. The player doesn't really have control of his own stuff and that's disappointing. The camera angles are locked so you can't really see who's petitioning you and the whole scene really looks not so alive, with characters frozen in place, without even an idle animation (imagine having an idle animation, isn't it something?).\n\nWhat else do we have? Making hybrid cultures and divergent cultures is all about combining modifiers you like and choosing how your units look. It's okayish... but I guess it would be much to ask for something more deep and creative from a game development studio that spent almost a year developing this DLC and charges 30$ for it? Oh, I dunno. \n\nAll in all, not much content, and the content we have is rather bland and unimaginative in my humble opinion. I paid for the deluxe or whatever version of CK3 that got me this DLC for \"free\", but the price they charge is rather high. 10$ - yeah, but the content here is worth 5$ and it is still too much. \n\nI really wanna love CK3 and Paradox and I was actually expecting them to make something good and of high quality, after 8 months this game went without any updated but if this DLC is a quality mark for the future, then I guess CK3 will never be better than CK2 and it sucks.", "timestamp_created": 1644491309, "timestamp_updated": 1644491309, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520780682563781738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109915935": {"recommendationid": "109915935", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185976119", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u4e00\u5e74\u534a\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c90\u5757\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2aDLC\u5c31\u8fd9\uff1f", "timestamp_created": 1644491159, "timestamp_updated": 1644491159, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109915927": {"recommendationid": "109915927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198345992641", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u542c\u8bf4\u4f60\u8dd1\u8def\u4e86\uff0c\u53c8\u56de\u6765\u505a\u4e86\u4e2aDLC\u9a97\u94b1", "timestamp_created": 1644491140, "timestamp_updated": 1644491140, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109915907": {"recommendationid": "109915907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198363629098", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "koreana", "review": "\uc774\uc9c0\uae08\uc758 \uc800\uc8fc", "timestamp_created": 1644491108, "timestamp_updated": 1644491108, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109915893": {"recommendationid": "109915893", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014447615", "num_games_owned": 535, "num_reviews": 47, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Not worth the price.

The Royal Court: Apart from 3D rendering of the court itself, displaying artifacts and (customisable) banners, the Hold Court Interaction adds RP elements through opt-in events, and can lead to a variety of in-game effects.\n2. Cultural overhaul: Seems really detailed. Cultural traditions and ethos incentivise playing to your culture and hybridisation/divergence/reformation give longer term gameplay goals. Cultural men-at-arms are now tied to traditions, meaning you can hybridise to get longbowmen, catapharacts, horse archers, varangians and war elephants, if you really want.\n3. Artifacts are back! Apart from some buffs and being able to display them in your court, you can buy claims on artifacts and scheme to steal them.\n4. Minor court positions are back too.\n5. Customisable banners are pretty neat - I wrote IKEA on the Swedish flag, for example.\n6. Changing your realm/culture/religion's map colour is a nice touch.\n7. Languages, meh, kind of just ties in with the cultural mechanics.\n\nI'm really happy with this expansion, as you can probably tell.

I believe an additional feature would've justified it fully, but I still feel that looking at it through the lense of almost a pseudo-\"subscription service\" makes more sense. \n\nI say this because they offer free updates all the time -- the dueling, for instance -- along with the Northern Lords flavor pack (which I would argue is underpriced at only 6.99). I have no problem supporting a dev team with only $45 per year (assuming only 2 flavor packs, 1 expansion) for all the other content that's provided over the course of 12 months, instead of having to buy a new game that doesn't expand much for $60 every 1.5-2 years. \n\nNot to mention that that they made many features free in this update, i.e. the cultures, which is a huge feature to make available for everyone. Many people, I believe, take free updates for granted and feel entitled to them with just the base game purchase.

Events such as Coronations, Weddings, Council Meetings and more would've really helped flesh out this feature and give it more reason to exist.

I love the base game, and what this adds *is* great and different - but it's just too narrowly applied.\n\nYou can view your royal court as a king rank or higher - but only if you are a kingdom or clan government. This should not be restricted - I want to see nomad khans in their tents gathering their kin and norse chiefs in their mead halls with their clans! Each major government would have had some form of 'court'.\n\nAlso - I would even argue that lower ranking can have a form of mundane meeting as well - greatly restricted, but could still call low borns or something.\n\nAlso, the rule where 'holding court' is restricted to 5 years. Why? - Why not give a major penalty if held within 5 years instead? - make it increasingly costly to hold court frequently - but it just seems arbitrary to take it away for 5 years.\n\nAgain, it feels weird - because it is good - but you won't get to see it unless you be very specific with the type of character/civilisation you play.\n\nI feel like they are going to break up what should have been a fuller experience into two different DLCs because $$$$$$$$$$.\n\nTL;DR - what is added is intriguing and unique, but the narrow application of it doesn't make it worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1644471493, "timestamp_updated": 1644471493, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109904405": {"recommendationid": "109904405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016696359", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Good DLC, bad price.

Lots of the mechanics make very little sense, add tedious levels of micromanagement or are just extremely underwhelming/generic:\n\n- Court Amenities get RESET/lowered on succession, which means when your character dies, for some reason your entire court just stops functioning: It goes from serving the best exotic meals to bread and soup in a matter of a day, everyone exchanges their fine garbs for peasant's attire, all the \"Endless servants\" disappear into thin air and your Grand lodgings get reverted back to shared bedrooms and straw mats. It also takes a long time to get your \"Court Grandeur\" back over time. WHY? No clue, I suppose this is their idea of balance, but it makes absolutely no sense and just means you have to do even more micro management on leader death. Speaking of which:\n\n-The reset also applies to Court Positions, which there's many, many of now. you have to click through and find proper characters for each (with \"Aptitudes\" that aren't explained at all), and of course every character dies sooner or later, so you endlessly have to look for new ones. You don't even get notifications when those important Courtiers die. Micro is good and all, but not really fun when all you're doing is getting minor boosts for a few years and you have to keep eyes open in several different menus.\n\n- Items/Artifacts are alright, but mostly the same generic stat sticks with very minor increases to secondary stats you'll barely need. Has some immersion/nonsensical issues which seems to be the theme of this DLC, with weird modifiers like \"+FERTILITY\" on gear like scepters, but compared to the other stuff this is the most serviceable, if underwhelming, feature\n\n-The Culture options are all good, very similar to Religion, and add even more potential for modding. But the Prestige costs are EXTREMELY expensive for making custom changes with some strange prerequisites (like not having different culture on your borders, or locked behind late innovations), so until fairly late into the game you likely won't be able to customize much. \n\n-For whatever godforsaken reason, Courts (the main feature of the DLC) are not available to Tribal rulers or anything below King tier. This not only makes ZERO historical sense (Genghis Khan, Longhouses, family houses that have been a thing since neolithic times and at their prime 800years BEFORE the game starts), it also makes you miss out on a lot of the content that would help especially lower rank rulers immensely.\n This decision especially just baffled me at how this could get past any sort of testing or rationality. You'd think ANYONE working at Paradox with a hint of historical knowledge would immediately bat an eye at this, but nope. You don't get to sit down in a hall and rule your lands until you reform your religion, become feudal, and become King at least, which means the majority of starts won't have access to the main content until 100+ years into the game.

The aforementioned royal court mechanic is the main aspect of the DLC, which is effectively divided into two systems: grandeur and events. By having court, you receive three events, with petitioners asking you to decide between various decisions. Some of which, such as permitting a noble to pay [b]you[/b] for the privilege of constructing a barony, is imbalanced or broken. Occasionally your court, even when not in progress, will receive random events as well, requiring you to return to the court screen.\n\nPersonally I find this aggravating, as these events are really nothing different than the kind you'd get receive that pop up. Effectively, I have to constantly return to this screen, even when I have no other reason to, to see an event. This is a minor complaint of course, but I find that it interferes with the flow of the gameplay.\n\nThe second mechanic, grandeur, is basically just another minor mana system that benefits every avenue of your realm and family the more of it you have. Generally the best way to get it is to spend money on your court, or just to spend money on events. New and revamped court positions can also influence it, which I think is good. Artifacts can also modify the baseline rate of grandeur.\n\nSpeaking of artifacts, the system for it is robust and rather simple. You can choose to seek out an artisan to make you an artifact, at a worse quality, or wait until a notification about a traveling inspired guest happens. Always take the inspired guest, they make better artifacts for effectively the same if not more reasonable prices. Annoyingly, they seem to have crammed in the rivalry system a bit with the procurement of artifact, as I find that every artifact I commission seems to come with an event or two aggravating my Antiquarian or some person at court. To this affect, having good diplomacy helps.\n\nThe culture system seems interesting, but the paid aspect of it is relatively minor. Unless you are actively going for strange culture hybrids, or playing as a tribal or norseman, you will likely not find yourself using much of it unless you go out of your way since it comes with ridiculously high renown requirements to change something even as small as a tradition.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nUltimately, Royal Court really isn't that special of a DLC, especially after waiting so long for it. For the price they're asking, as a supposed 'major expansion' to CK3, it causes reasonable concern to wonder what the future path for this game looks like.  Even after some long delays, the actual released content is not that significant, and in many cases (such as the royal court itself!) feels like an actual paid mod.\n\nPersonally, as a Royal Edition owner, I find it upsetting since the expansion content we paid for is so far a small norse-flavor pack and now an overpriced new screen and culture mechanics that encourage meta-play.", "timestamp_created": 1644462693, "timestamp_updated": 1644462858, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519324123859405518", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109899464": {"recommendationid": "109899464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198167877994", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The dlc does not add enough content to justify $30 dollars enough said people are praising this dlc because of the neat immersion features and cool little things , but artifcats were in ck2 and 3d models are cool and the culture stuff is cool ,but even with those features and a few extra features added this dlc is no way in hell worth half a triple A game.", "timestamp_created": 1644462512, "timestamp_updated": 1644462512, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.495506316423416138", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109899311": {"recommendationid": "109899311", "author": {"steamid": "76561198187973071", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Sadly the Paradox method of making games and DLC is very anti-consumer, just look at the price of this DLC that adds a *minor* addition to the game that does not even effect tribal nations.

Also the court room has a lot of restrictions and sometimes glitches out a bit. Overall this dlc feels rather shallow and definitely not worth the asking price of 30$. My advice would be to wait for it to go on sale for 10-15$ and then maybe pick it up.

What I like most are my interactions with vassals in 3D and getting more chances to create friendships or rivalries. \n\nNow if you\u2019re primarily a strategy gamer I can see this DLC being more of a disappointment. The bonuses for artifacts and court levels aren\u2019t that game changing, and I can see strategists feeling like they need to do every interaction to squeeze out some extra renown or gold. Courts also don\u2019t work at duke level unless you play mods. There's also the ability to reform your culture or even combine cultures. For example,  in one game I became half Norse-half Scottish as Ivar the Boneless. This is a cool feature but IMHO not as interesting as reforming religions. \n\nSo in summary, I highly recommend if you want to feel more invested in your characters.

I feel like the artifact system could be further fleshed out so you have something to do with all the excess items you end up hoarding, but it is a good start. The system of diverging and hybrid cultures is really cool, as it adds replayability to different parts of the world other than just genociding everyone into your culture each campaign. The languages are also cool but I think the court language feature could be more developed. One last thing that I really enjoyed was the new music tracks.

For context, I am speaking mainly from the PoV as a roleplayer who hates minmaxing.\n\nThe culture rework is ambitious and while wonky in a few places (such as debatable choices for some culture's traditions and ethoses) a good step in revolutionizing cultures to be more dynamic compared to previous GSG games. Ethoses are boring and might border on stereotypical/pop history, but traditions are where the new additions shine - for both roleplayers and minmaxers, there's a lot of stuff that's offered in finding interesting traditions to take advantage of. Languages are cool flavor as well, and reflect an aspect of history not often seen in strategy games.\n\nArtifacts are perhaps the funnest part of the expansion to me. There's a lot of stuff that can happen to them behind the scenes, and they're more dynamic than their CK2 counterparts from both a gameplay perspective and how they're coded.\n\nNew events and decisions are also fun and nice for roleplay, and always welcome.\n\nThe big letdown for me is 3D courts which, while nice and definitely something the devs put a lot of time and love into, are underwhelming to me from a roleplay PoV - it's nice to see my characters, sure, but it feels like a side distraction that's disjointed from the game, and a glorified variation of the event window at times. Hopefully it will be improved on in the future.\n\n[B][U]TLDR: All in all, a solid 8/10 DLC giving CK3 much needed life especially as a roleplayer, that expands flavor and gameplay for all parts of the map in a well-integrated manner, though not without its issues.[/U][/B] As to whether it's worth your money, I will hesitantly say yes, given how much content is offered, but I can absolutely understand if others see the price as too high.", "timestamp_created": 1644459287, "timestamp_updated": 1644470899, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.593187928199768066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109897403": {"recommendationid": "109897403", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069182869", "num_games_owned": 209, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "CK3 Royal Court is a decent DLC, but not worth 30\u20ac. While nothing is wrong with any of the new court mechanics they also aren't that great that they earn the price tag. Let's go into detail.\n\nMechanically you pay for the ability to hybridise and diverge cultures and for the court system itself. I will mostly focus on the core of the DLC, the court, but acknowledge that the new culture system is great. \n\nMechanics\n\nThe court system is a way for non-tribal emperors and kings to tunnel some of that high gold income in to other avenues like prestige or renown and to incur some other benefits. Each court has a court type, court language and amenities, four sliders with five steps each that influence your base glamour and each have different benefits. Glamour is basically your court level and the higher it is, the more benefits you unlock. Court types are influenced by your culture type and also confer various benefits depending on your glamour level. Court language also affects glamour and in the case of less powerful courts and kingdoms, it may behoof themselves in adopting the language of a more powerful court/country.\n\nYou can hold court and court event can happen. Holding court gives you three events which can give you some boons or drawbacks. Beyond that you can get petitioned by vassals or as a vassal petition yourself. Once a liege, a vassal can also present themselves to court, giving the liege renown and the vassal other bonuses as well.\n\nThen there are the artifacts. You can commission artifacts, like tapestries, weapons or even books to wear or showcase in the court. These also give beneifts, mostly in the form of prestige and glamour. They generally have durability and you need to repaired them every so often. While the general artifact system is free, to use those showcased in the court you need the DLC.\n\nLastly, there are court positions, similar to the minor titles in CK2. These are free of charge and include your Court Physician and others. Having the Royal Court DLC enables certain special roles for kings and emperors, like a Seneshal that speeds up construction, or a food taster that can save your life at the risk of said taster being in cahoots with plotters. The largest issue with these is that there are a lot of positions and when you play at higher speeds position holders tend to die away. There is pop up, but depending on what you are doing it's a flash in the pan and you miss it.\n\nVisuals\n\nI'll be frank, the visuals of the DLC are lacking. The court culture types are nice, what exists is well modeled, however I question why the court rooms were included in the first place. What you see in the screenshots is what you get. Courtiers standing still, some in new idle poses, doing nothing, while your displayed artifacts are lovelessly being shown in the room. If they are in the capital your character sits on the large seat, while their (first) spouse sits left next to them. Women for some reason kneel im most cultures, looking like they are doing penance or going to confession, but this is not the primary issue. \n\nThe primary issue is that there is no dynamism. Regardless of how much money you invest in the court, visually it stays the same. A court with no amenities looks the same as a court with every amenity under the sun. One amenity you can invest in is fashion, however beyond the numerical bonuses your court won't change their attire. This goes further. The game now forces you to open the court view to do certain events, however beyond involved characters being in certain idle animations there is no reason to open the window. The court itself doesn't even react to the scenes. The events are still dealt with in an event window and with a lot of events you will need to leave the view to find a title or character. Finally, there is the camera. It is locked to three different angles by default with events moving the camera around a bit, but nothing more.\n\nAfter having looked at the different cultural courts and the initial court events there is nothing there to keep the player coming back. Even roleplayers will not be satisfied. Did their grand vision for the DLC not work out? I don't know, I can only critique something that is there.", "timestamp_created": 1644459243, "timestamp_updated": 1644498595, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109897394": {"recommendationid": "109897394", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048064207", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "it's fun. it adds a lot of extra content, I recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1644459236, "timestamp_updated": 1644459236, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109897389": {"recommendationid": "109897389", "author": {"steamid": "76561198326745119", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u975e\u5e38\u597ddlc,sc+15", "timestamp_created": 1644459224, "timestamp_updated": 1644459224, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542010068893432617", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109897284": {"recommendationid": "109897284", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103147558", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5dee\u8bc4\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a3", "timestamp_created": 1644459059, "timestamp_updated": 1644459059, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109897106": {"recommendationid": "109897106", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071593998", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "french", "review": "M\u00eame en l'ayant pay\u00e9 moins cher (20\u20ac), je me sens quand m\u00eame l\u00e9s\u00e9.

(St\u00e4ndige Wiederholung der selben Abl\u00e4ufe) \n- Fehlende Mechaniken f\u00fcr den nett anzusehenden Hof lassen ihn schnell als nutzlos erscheinen lediglich die Boni sind gut. \n- Nur K\u00f6nige oder Kaiser k\u00f6nnen einen aktiven Hof haben was irgendwie schlecht durchdacht wirkt und historisch v\u00f6llig falsch ist. \n- Gerade Hof Mechaniken die mehr Spieltiefe bieten sucht man vergeblich.

I like this expansion.\n\nParadox is frequently criticized for DLC being too expensive. I don't know what to say to that. I have 250+ hours played of Crusader Kings III. Much of that is from the baseline game. I didn't get Northern Lords until recently. With this expansion, I will likely play at least another 100 hours. So between $2.50 - $3.80 per hour played. Seems like a good value to me. \n\nI like this expansion because it adds a vital element to Crusader Kings: something to do other than paint the map. A big learning curve for new CK players is telling them it's ok if nothing happens for months, years, or decades. Sometimes your realm is doing ok and you're just riding the wave baby. With Royal Court, there's always something happening. It's not always important. Sometimes it's trivial and easy to ignore, but there's something going on.\n\nI played Crusader Kings for the role playing element of the game and Royal Court adds to that. To me, this is an essential DLC. More than that, I want Paradox to make more DLC like this. I don't care to play as the tribal north, or in other regions with other stuff going on like India... well maybe idk I would I don't actually know... but if it were up to me I'd ask for a deeper more role-playing orientated improvement to the classic Europe game I already love. \n\nIf I have a gripe with Royal Court, it's the repetition of certain scenarios. I've played it for maybe 8-12 hours and I keep getting new issues at court, so that's a sign there's a lot of content. However, I've had maybe 5 physicians steal bodies from the local cemetery. It's silly to see that same issue happen to every ruler, sometimes multiple times, with the same physician. I think they could add more of those.\n\nI also think the user interface is a little clunky when considering other things within the Royal Court view. For example, i'll get a dilemma like Joe from Town A and Bill from Town B are disputing, but it's not easy for me to look at Towns A and B without completely Xing out of the entire interface. I don't exactly remember all the towns in my domain.\n\nOtherwise, I wish there was a Royal Court interface for lower lords. If I'm a count or a duke, can I make asks of the King every now and then? Or can I hold my own court for lower-rank issues? That seems vital. The game should be fun at all stages, not just kings and emperors imo.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy with it.", "timestamp_created": 1644454685, "timestamp_updated": 1644454685, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109894556": {"recommendationid": "109894556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198208946425", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Alot of hate for the price tag, which is understandable.

The systems included in it are deep and engaging both for min-maxers and role-players. The new culture mechanics are the best system for representing cultural practices in any strategy game I've ever played. They allow for change, divergence, and hybridization to happen dynamically and to actually matter, with tangible benefits.\n\nThe Royal Court itself is the single most ambitious system Paradox has ever added to any game. While some lesser expansions of other titles can be accused of simply adding more modifiers, the court adds a stage for the drama of intrigue and diplomacy to play out in. Both literally, thanks to the physical representation of the space itself, and metaphorically insofar as it allows for a host of new interactions.\n\nFinally, the artifact system is back from CK2 but is both far better balanced, better integrated with other systems (you can display artifacts in your court), and is just generally more interesting.\n\nI think there are only two complaints I have so far: 1) the price is high, and 2) there are a few bugs.\n\nI personally think the price is reasonable for what this is: a content rich and systemically sophisticated expansion. It is priced similarly to a full Civ V or VI expansion, and it feels like it adds as much or more to the game. That being said, for Paradox fans used to the level of content typically on offer in a new Paradox expansion, I think the price clearly is raising some red flags for people. Rest assured, this expansion is well worth the money.\n\nAs for the bugs, I suspect they will be ironed out fairly quickly. I haven't experienced anything game breaking, but something is wrong with the 3d models for characters (they all look a bit uncanny) and I've had some faction formation notifications coming up way too often (once every few days). These are ultimately annoying but don't ruin the experience. But I was hoping for a slightly smoother experience given how long this has been in development.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the Royal Court to anyone who enjoys CK3 and wants a deeper experience.

There were so many possibilities that could have come with this dlc but paradox has dropped the ball once again with an outrageous price for a VERY minor dlc. For $30 you get a 3D royal court to 'interact' with, an overhaul to cultures, more court positions, and a new artifact system. Now at first you might think you are getting what amounts to a complete overhaul considering this is $30. No, you will be getting a 3D courtroom (only if you are a kingdom or empire) that is extremely bland, an artifact system that is decent but arbitrary, and a nice culture rework. None of this is worth $30, nothing it adds is necessary to the game and most importantly, the focus of the dlc seemed to be building a 3D space that is quite honestly subpar. The events that happen in your court can range anywhere from decent to straight up bad. There will be times where somebody will come to your court, make their plea, and your choices are bad, really bad, and really really bad. The over 20 court positions have about 5 useful ones while the rest are fluff, your throne room is a bunch of 3D models standing completely still while occasionally looking around or swinging their arms with generic crowd noise in the background. When you hold court it is more or less the same as dilemmas the only difference is now your camera is in the throne room which again, doesn't move or have voice acting. Now credit where credit is due, the culture overhaul is very nice. There are around 6 ethos that set up the base of your culture and around 70 traditions to select from, it is a very nice system to set up some long term goals but there isn't much more to it. Overall I feel this dlc was an extreme overuse of resources for something that nobody was really asking for, a 3D court is nice but not at the cost of all substance in the dlc. $30 for what this dlc offers is ludicrous and really goes to show how paradox plans to put as little effort in with as large of a price-point that they can get away with.", "timestamp_created": 1644447190, "timestamp_updated": 1644447190, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109880006": {"recommendationid": "109880006", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083317650", "num_games_owned": 273, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Most of the features in Royal Court are nice but hot damn it is not worth $29.99. Game for the most part plays out the same except there are new mechanics connected to artifacts, culture, and the ability to have a 3D model of a throne room. The new culture mechanics are nice because they add way more flavor to how they work, instead of just forcing your entire region into your culture type, you can merge cultures together to get the best bonuses of said cultures. You can diverge away from your culture into a new one or reform your already existing one. The artifacts are a nice feature but CK2 had artifacts too, this isn't a new feature but a pre-existing one imported from CK2. The throne room feels like a gimmick. It honestly feels boring and if it wasn't for the artifact/furniture slots in the throne room to give bonuses, it feels like a massive waste of time. It adds flavor to the roleplay prespective but definitely doesnt add jack to the gameplay. If the dlc was worth $20 I would recommend it but $30 feels way too steep, even by Paradox's reputation. $30 for some new mechanics but I would have rather sunk the $30 into something else.

I really like a lot of the mechanics added such as the new dynamic culture system and the 3D court. However, I have issues when it comes to content based around them. \n\nOn Culture:\nI played as Duke William in 1066 with the idea that blending cultures of Anglo-Saxon and Norman would be an interesting path. However I found that once winning the war and moving my capitol to London I got the old decision to form English Culture. From my basic understanding it would be disadvantageous to build cultural acceptance and form my own convergent culture with Anglo-Saxon based solely on the time required to do so. That leaves me with questions: \n\nWhy does this event not require any cultural acceptance or any new requirements for that matter? \nWhy does this event exist the way it does?\n Where is the roleplaying of moving your capital and on the same day form a new culture?\n\n It would be nice if this event instead of bypassing the new DLC it would embrace it and incorporate it. A suggestion I would have is to require the same level of cultural acceptance to take the decision. The one nice portion is that English Culture does get new Ethos in Longbows.\n\n3D Courts:\nI am sad to say that it is an absolute performance nightmare. I have a 2080s, but still would be maxing out my GPU and hitting temps of upwards of 80C whereas I would normally only get to ~60-70C pre-DLC. This point will probably be irrelevant as new patches come out improving performance (hopefully). \n\nFinding out that nomads/tribals don't have a court is just sad. I was hoping to play a Viking raider holding a court in a wooden hut surrounded by the great artifacts I have conquered from around the world (Speaking of artifacts they feel so small and insignificant in the court). \n\nOverall I think the DLC is average to good with lots of potential left on the table (for mods to pick up at this point). While I wish Steam would allow more nuanced scores rather than yes/no I feel like my voice will only be heard by developers if I highlight the aspects that were disappointing. \n6/10 - Wait for a sale/patch", "timestamp_created": 1644446190, "timestamp_updated": 1644446190, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109879427": {"recommendationid": "109879427", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125942078", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "german", "review": "Ich habe das DLC von einem Freund geschenkt bekommen, deswegen ist es f\u00fcr mich schwierig im Bereich des Preises vom DLC einzugehen. Jedoch kann ich auf jeden Fall sagen, dass das DLC seinen Preis nicht wert ist. Wenn man es f\u00fcr unter 20 Euro bekommt, ist das eine andere Geschichte.\n\nDie Gameplay features finde ich aber schon echt cool gemacht. Wenn ich meinen Hof halte und ich auf die Probleme meiner Vasallen eingehe, sehe wie sie sich vor mich verbeugen, dann f\u00fchlt sich das schon wirklich immersive an. Finde aber ein wenig schade, dass die Artefakte teilweise sehr lame im Raum plaziert werden. Vor allem bei Waffen ist mir dies aufgefallen, da dann wenn man ein Schwert in seinem Hof ausstellt in der Mitte des Raumes einfach ein Waffenst\u00e4nder mit der Waffe drauf steh und das ist schon sehr unbefriedigend. Ich w\u00fcnschte mir in dem Bereich, dass man Waffen an die Wand und dann vielleicht auch mehrere Waffen auf einem Slot h\u00e4ngen k\u00f6nnte.\n\nDann finde ich auch schade, dass man die Ausr\u00fcstung, welche man in seinem Inventar tr\u00e4gt nicht optisch an seinem Charakter sieht. Das einzige was sich hier \u00e4ndert sind die Stats, was sehr entt\u00e4uschend ist. In Crusader Kings 2 hat man auch z.b. die eigenen Kronen gesehen, die man gebaut hat.\n\nSonst ist der Rest meiner Meinung nach echt gut gemacht. Es macht finde ich bisher Spa\u00df ein Hof zu halten, es macht Spa\u00df sich mit den Kulturen auseinanderzusetzen, vor allem wenn man ein Gro\u00dfreich hat mit vielen verschiedenen Kulturen und Sprachen. Diese Tiefe hat das Spiel nach 1 Jahr ohne zugef\u00fcgtem Content auf jeden Fall gebraucht, deshalb lohn sich das DLC meiner Meinung nach auch.\n\nWas ich auf jeden Fall noch erw\u00e4hnen muss ist, dass endlich das Kriegssystem ein komplettes Rework braucht. CK hat bei weitem das schlechteste Kriegssystem von allen Paradoxspielen und dazu auch das langweiligste und das nervigste, da Kriege einfach nur sehr repetitiv und grindy sind.

However, $40 was a steal for the base game before the free patch, and now I'd consider that ridiculously low for what you're getting.

Also you should note that if you start as a Count or a Duke, the royal court feature only becomes available at the King or Emperor level. This means the vast majority of available characters to play won\u2019t have any interaction with the DLC at all. And by the time you\u2019ve hit king or Emperor you\u2019ve basically already \u201cwon\u201d so this becomes a victory lap simulator.\nUnfortunately it\u2019s just more bonus stacking. Everything you do merely adds more meaningless positive modifiers. \nHere\u2019s an example: I\u2019m playing Basil I in 867. I get a pop-up that someone has an inspiration to craft a piece of jewelry. A few events later and I have some kind of brooch. All that clicking and reading for\u2026+.22 prestige per month? Nothing against the writing, which is clever, but the rewards just don\u2019t seem that commensurate with the input requirements, which frequently involves years worth of income. The crafting events repeat as well in future projects (this was a problem in Holy Fury too), so I had to admonish my wife repeatedly to avoid her ruining my chances of a good item. Which I guess is exactly the sort of wacky meme stuff they\u2019re setting out to do with this game now.\nOn a technical level the royal court itself is very laggy, any camera movement will result in choppiness and stuttering. The lighting is also bizarre, most of the characters look like they\u2019re glowing in my gloomy castle. \nSo no pop system, no economy, not much to do in the way of realm management, and the new culture system is part of the free update. $30 gets you something that makes the game run worse and will make you notice immediately how small the event pool still is.

Yes. I'd even go so far as to say some parts of the DLC are good. \n\nHOWEVER, I am not recommending Royal Court due to its outrageous price tag for the amount of content and too narrow a scope for its price tag. Why do only Emperors and Kings get a court? Dukes and Counts should also have courts (albeit a smaller scale appropriate to their station). There are too few court styles. Why, having just had a Northern Lords Norse flavour pack, is there not a Norse themed throne room for owners of that pack?\n\nThe amount of time and money spent on the 3D court, while cool, isn't worth it from a game play perspective. The throne room is static, nothing cool happens there with its static view and ridiculously easy grandeur level progression. When you hold a feast, there's not even a different view, signalling a grand event is happening at your court right now! Courtiers standing in random areas, limited atmosphere...all for what? $33 CAD and a couple small buffs via items? \n\nTLDR: Disappointing for how long development was and the price tag.

However, I think some people are underselling it. It adds court mechanics, as well as artifacts you can commission, plunder, find, give, trade, show off in your court, wear... Plus the content in the accompanying free update which includes a pretty major rework of how culture works.

I mean, it does provide useful mechanics and whatnot, but I think it is mostly a boon for RP'ers. It really brings your court and realm to life, and you no longer view those things as just borders on a map. The cultural mechanics are also great if you're not so RP inclined (though they still cater to RP'ers), they're kind of like an improved religion mechanic, and add a lot more depth to the game. I can say the same for the new inventory system as well.\n\nIs the price high? Yeah. Is it reasonable compared to other Paradox games, yeah I'd say so. It is substantially larger than most other expansions, and CK3 DLCs come out much more infrequently (this has been in the works for what, 1.5 years?). Now, is Paradox's DLC policy in general unreasonable? Maybe, I'm not sure, but I don't blame you if you think it is. I just don't agree with the reviews which are comparing this expansion's price to the expansion price pertaining to titles from games like EU4 or HOI4. \n\nOverall, if you're comfortable spending a bit more than usual, this DLC is a huge step up as far as Paradox and CK games go, and I recommend it wholeheartedly, especially for RP'ers.", "timestamp_created": 1644436467, "timestamp_updated": 1644436467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109871916": {"recommendationid": "109871916", "author": {"steamid": "76561198219771103", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly I think it's absurd that with such a big dlc about cultures they didnt even bother making the map more historical accurate by adding the many minority cultures that WERE eventually a part of a CK2 dlc. \n\nI STILL CANT PLAY AS THE ARBERIANS, FIX THIS!!", "timestamp_created": 1644436285, "timestamp_updated": 1644436285, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109871884": {"recommendationid": "109871884", "author": {"steamid": "76561198772986602", "num_games_owned": 58, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s a good dlc.

Recommended for roleplayers and for experienced players looking for replay value.\n\nOverall, this expansion succeeds in making prestige and gold more valuable and useful than in the base game, tying the former into the new grandeur system and using the latter to fund inspirations and pay for court expenditures. Growing your court alongside your empire will be much more engaging, and the new cultural mechanics make managing a large empire much more interesting and dynamic. Highly recommended for anyone looking for more mechanics to consider, deeper roleplaying, or more interesting large-domain management.\n\nThe Throne Room:\n-Represents the characters and court in a grounded, physical way unlike anything in previous paradox games. The individual interactions displayed here greatly improve immersion and the role-playing of interacting with your vassals.\n-Seeing your character in a 3D space, surrounded by symbols of your wealth and power, shifts the feeling of the game from playing as a nation and map-painting like many other paradox games and reinforces the unique status of CK3 as a medieval roleplaying experience.\n-Holding court adds context to many of the events you might see in the base game, while adding many, many more events for a player to experience. After seeing most of the events the base game has to offer, these new interactions significantly improve replayability.\n-Court positions make paying attention to the skills of guests more important, and tie together with plots, warfare, and court mechanics well.\n\nCultural mechanics:\n-Cultures finally have mechanics for dynamic growth and emergence, making culture as important and flexible as the base game's religion system\n-Language and cultural heritage add depth to cultural differences. These build on the existing culture group system to create a much more dynamic system for the internal conflicts of large, multicultural empires.\n-When growing a small duchy to a powerful empire, you now have the option to facilitate the growth and divergence of your culture, rather than painting the map with a single culture (looking at you, Andalusian)\n-Cultural uprisings now have more context and feel like a reactive part of your interactions with your subjects, rather than just a mob of peasants\n\nArtifacts and Equipment:\n-The least interesting part of the update, somewhat awkward, but ties in well to the court system. Overall an improvement from CK2's implementation, but barely.\n-Event chains from adventurers and craftsmen are engaging and interesting, and can spice up an uneventful year\n-Legendary weapons and objects are fun, but honestly the most engaging use of the system is acquiring a crown, regalia, a throne, and other items when first growing your court\n\nWhile this DLC is more expensive than expansions for older games by this developer, I can see its mechanics remedying many of the frustrations I had with the game and easily doubling the time I will put into the game.

The new systems are completely changing the way the a playthrough unfolds, and pretty much all for the better. Sure, there are a few interface annoyances, but they are minor compared to the sheer delight of seeing what new weird items your dynasty picks up on its journey through the centuries.\nThe culture rework is massive, and totally awesome, and I encourage people to think of it as part of the expansion even though it is free. The devs clearly had to make this feature free because it is so deeply embedded in the game systems that it can't be enabled just for the expansion and turned off for the base game. \nThe decisions you make regarding the evolution of your culture are extremely rich in terms of both role-playing AND strategy, and I just love it. My African king sails up the coast and siezes Cordoba - prior to the rework this would have been purely for the mechanics of getting the special building and switching to a more advanced culture so I could feudalise. After the rework? Suddenly I don't want to change culture; sure they have more technology, but their traditions are crap (hit an run tacticians, lolwut?), so instead I am putting my steward to work trying to convince the Cordobans that my people are not that bad and we should merge our ways together. It's still a painfully slow process, so I try and speed it up by conquering some more Andalusian lands, which helps because our realms are intermingling more (even if in the short term the Andalusians are mad at me for declaring war on their territory). Eventually I create the new 'Cordoban' culture, gaining the technological knowledge of the Andalusians, the much cooler traditions of the Malinke (sorcerous metalurgy, yes please!), and teaching my people back home how to speak the much-more-useful Arabic language. And this is just round one of the story of my realm's evolving culture. Utter, freaking, briliant.\nThink of this expansion as the next chapter in the evolution of the game, and if you buy it (you should) think of yourself as supporting the continued development of the game as a whole.

Tons of new events, items and actual things to do other than war! The new events and systems really flesh out the game more for what it is supposed to be, a character / dynasty simulator. The people who are only interested in war might not care as much about Royal Court for it but all of the new things to do really make the game more interesting. You know how it is, different strokes for different folks. \n\nEven more exiting is how good a system like this will be for modding, can't wait to see what the big fantasy mods can do with all of this when they are finally released. \n\nFor those of us that play CK games as more than a map painting game, this is a great DLC that really makes the game feel more alive and interesting. If all you care about is warfare then it's something you can skip, there are weapons and other items that help in war, give you more stats and bonuses but I don't think it's worth buying the DLC for that alone. I usually like to play as a smaller lord but now I really enjoy being a King and managing my court. I really recommend Royal court for those of you who are interested in events, role playing and what not. \n\nAs for pricing, I don't buy Paradox DLC at full price, sorry but I'm poor and can't afford it. They always give us a free patch that add some new things and improvements and I don't mind waiting for a good deal more in my price range. Always wait for a sale unless money is not an issue for you in my opinion, considering I bought the royal addition of the game on sale for like $45 or less (Paradox and others sell keys off steam for a little less that you can then use on steam. Check the safe/trusted sites for sales the same time you see a steam sale. Make sure you look into the site to make sure it's legit, not all key websites are safe or are even allowed to sell the keys they have.), and I'm happy with what I paid for. \n\nWe knew the price of the major DLC for CK3 will be $30, we where told this before the game came out. They spent over a year on this and I think it's fair, just wait for a sale in the future if you are on the fence about pricing. Over time, as with all Paradox games you will be able to get DLC for 75% off if not higher at times, it's just a matter of waiting.", "timestamp_created": 1644431109, "timestamp_updated": 1644431109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109867568": {"recommendationid": "109867568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247779284", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The new features presented in this DLC make it worth it IMO", "timestamp_created": 1644431050, "timestamp_updated": 1644431050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109867566": {"recommendationid": "109867566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198321972891", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The Royal Court adds a great layer of interaction with the game characters.

Whilst there are still a lot that can be added to the game, it was a good place to start after the Northern Lords flavour pack. In my view, Royal Court is well worth the full price for such a feature-rich DLC. \n\nThe enhanced culture system is great as it introduces a dynamic system that allows you to evolve your culture and this makes the game even more enjoyable to play. It also adds novel ways to gain new traditions and makes the game an even better story-telling experience. Showing off your artifacts, holding court and the extra court positions are wonderful additions as well.

People are being absolutely ridiculous about this DLC, and I don't think they have any idea how precarious PDX is right now, and how important this expansion was.\n\nI would like to say, my review is that this is a very good expansion. To paraphrase something ProudBavarian said about the expansion, it can completely change the way you interact with the game and leans heavily into roleplaying which is the thing I most appreciate about CK3 as a title in particular. I saw a review that said it was $30 for \"minor mechanics\" and that is completely unfair-- adding a 3D space with positioned characters to a game where usually you spend 90% of the time staring at a map is a massive departure from form and a very ambitious addition to the game. \n\nWould it be cool if there were Tribal Courts, or lower level Duke and Count courts? Of course, but there is every expectation that such a thing will be added later, perhaps even in a free update. How could we expect that? By looking at the free culture features which came along with this update. The new culture system is a massive upgrade to the former system, as large in scope as the entire religion system was at release, and everyone got it for free. The one best way to make sure you never get Tribal or Ducal courts is to tell people not to buy this DLC, and not to buy the next flavor pack.\n\nI think if you play CK3 to tell stories and revel in the drama that comes with building your legacy, this expansion is an absolute must-have.

The lategame would have needed more challenges, decorating a court might be a fun lategame activity, but will it stay motivating longtime?\n\nLanguages feel useless, they were better represented by cultures. The language learing decisions could have just targetted French instad of Langue d'Oil.\n\nI do not like the cultural overhaul, it is a step away from hostorical simulation and historical role-playing towards a min-/max-playstyle with stacking boni (what EU4 has become). Instead of +10% income from this building or +5% more of that, I would have prefered things like cultural feasts, events, inheritance laws and other things which increase immersion.\n\nArtifacts are welcome, we had them in CK2, but those equppable 3d models make it the best part of the dlc.", "timestamp_created": 1644425394, "timestamp_updated": 1644425394, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.530201315879821777", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109862472": {"recommendationid": "109862472", "author": {"steamid": "76561198015897237", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Tribals don't get a court... so if you want to play as a norse raider to steal some artifacts... too bad for you.

The artifact and the court systems, as well as the improved cultures, add much needed depth to the otherwise bland base game. The culture aspect is especially enjoyable with its wide variety of choices as well as providing an outlet for prestige that previously tended to build-up when playing feudal rulers. What is disappointing is the implementation of the court mechanic for feudal governments only. While \"tribal\" governments may not have historically held court in the same way it is portrayed in this DLC, there are plenty of historic analogues that could utilize this mechanic existing within what is CK3's current gross over-generalization of tribal/nomadic peoples in game. This fact is ironically contrasted with Paradox's own sponsored YouTube content leading up to the DLC's release, specifically those videos exploring historical Mongol court protocol. I hope to see this remedied in the future.\n\nAdditionally, the use of 3D models in Royal Court is a departure from previous content and the developer's aims feel misguided when considering what the majority of the community is looking to get out of this game. It seems likely that this decision soaked up much development resources leading to the aforementioned lack-luster and even partially implemented court mechanic., This is not to mention the the price tag, which is at least twice what you should be paying for DLC. If you'd like to play Royal Court, I would recommend waiting for a sale.\n\nEDIT: Upon playing the DLC further, it seems like the artifact and, primarily, court interactions are somewhat superficial.

As \"amusing\" as it was, it broke what little immersion i had. After that i turned the game off, it is clear that nobody ever tested this garbage. This event should be programmed as an extremely rare, not happen almost every single time you utilize the game's key mechanic. Also the way its implemented doesnt make any sense, it shouldnt be coded this way, when it just selects random charaters to usurp holdings, it makes zero sense for holdings of the queen to be usurped by a baby. One very impatient baby, considering it was going to inherent them anyway.\n\nEDIT: After glossing over other reviews, I've decided to chime in with my opinion about the price matter and overall quality of this DLC. \nLook guys, when they're selling you the DLC that breaks graphics and adds a ton of bugs which they never bothered to test over a year while this \"expansion\" was in development, at this point you're basically doing their job for them and testing their product. So no, you shouldnt pay $30 for an opportunity to participate in the beta-test. They're the ones who should pay you. \n\nAlso, what ppl in the positive reviews are calling \"new mechanics\" are really just new buttons you can press to get flat modifiers, like pay 100 gold to the artisan - get a legendary sword that adds 1 prowess (which is like nothing). Also you get to create hybrid-cultures, hooray! Its exactly like creating religions in the base game, only duller. Wow, so much innovation, this gameplay is fire.\n\nConclusion: do not buy, not even on sale. Even if they fix all the bugs, which they wont, its still a bad dlc that doesnt really add anything new to the game. Promo screenshots were just lie, you never have interesting feasts in your court or anything like that.\n\nAfter all, why did people like previous installments of this franchize? Because of the storytelling and because of the interesting events. In this game you see basically all the events this game has in the first 3 hours you play, so it was obvious, for me anyway, that the first DLC desperately needed to add some storytelling content. But all you really get is a hall with broken lighting and frozen statues with ugly facial features, because this DLC also decided to downgrade the graphics, on top of adding a bunch of bugs. It doesnt add what it needed to add for this game, game is still just a boring map painting simulator. What little events it has are at best poorly thought out and at worst are immersion-breaking. Nothing worse that a game can be other than being boring.\n\ndear paradox, if you want your games better received: hire new writers and hire at least some testers, i know you think you got an army of unpaid shills to do that, but actually you do pay, not with money, but with your reputation. Also get a new product manager, from the premise to execution this DLC screams of the lack of coherent vision of what this game wants to be.

For the record I had about 6 hours of Royal Court playtime at the time of this review, before anyone gets their knickers in a twist. ;-)", "timestamp_created": 1644422874, "timestamp_updated": 1644423388, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490487366914749146", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109860192": {"recommendationid": "109860192", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020240145", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 35, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "every government type should have acces royal court", "timestamp_created": 1644422811, "timestamp_updated": 1644422811, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109860184": {"recommendationid": "109860184", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040225475", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't mind that the price of DLC can be more expensive, but the production team should do more content of new plots and events, reduce the repeatability of the game and improve the playability.

This feels very much like a normal $20 DLC that should have come out 3 months ago. Of the 1.5.0 features, I was more excited for the free customizable banners than any paid feature. In addition, the lack of free camera in the court, and limiting it to kings and emperors were two of the first things I changed with mods. The base game is fantastic and made even better with the free features in 1.5.0, and this DLC is a step down by comparison.\n\nThat being said, Royal Court marks a decisive turn away from min-maxing and towards immersive role-play, and this is the first time I've ever lost track of time playing CK3. In a way, this DLC is almost necessary towards this role-play vision, even if the features are rather limited. I highly encourage Paradox to continue down this path with future expansions.\n\nOverall I'd highly suggest waiting for a $10-$15 sale a year or two from now. However I firmly believe that you should still plan on getting it as some point if you like the role-playing side of CK3.

This doesnt address any of them. Want something new to do between 880-1200? Nah, nothing new exists. You'll still be expanding, dealing with the AI trying to jump you, and endless, endless succession problems. \n\nGrandure is a few button clicks to handle, new minor positions have little impact on your court, you still have to take time combing through endless generic NPCs with sub par stats trying to force themselves in positions they dont deserve and pissing them off has little consequences. \n\nThe good feature, designing your own coat of arms, is free.\n\nThe events from holding court range from, terrible, to \"recycled events that were moved into the court\". On a positive though the \"Get a cat\" event seems to repeat pretty often so it's more common to get a cat instead of once a playthrough. \n\nByz is still stupidly stable, the abbasids still collapse near endlessly, the AI still cannot assist in combat.

We were told that CK3 was this highly efficient and modular platform that was going to get barrels of content. In the same time frame that CK2 was out, we had received new religions, new governments, buckets of content and entirely fresh systems. Sure, the DLC model was parasitic then, but at least we were getting *something*. This is just... beyond the pale.\n\nThirty bucks gets you a 3D court room bauble that looks stiff and lifeless, adds nothing to the game other than being a gold sink for passive bonuses, and includes court positions that we mostly already had in CK2. Relics and artifacts? Already in CK2 as well, and honestly far less intrusive. Enjoy finding exciting relics that grant you tiny opinion boosts or +2 prowess and then having to pay tons of gold to some asshole so they don't degrade. Culture hybridization is just another set of rules like religion, but less enticing. The new culture system feels like something that could have been designed in a week. Add a flimsy window for adding cultural tenets or tendencies or whatever the fuck they are called, a couple decisions, and a new advisor job, and done. I guess some players will make meme cultures like Norse-Turkish and call the expansion great, but once you've messed with the culture system once or twice, there's not much more to see. It's shallow. The moment to moment experience of the game is relatively unchanged. Religions are still all the same, no new governments (which we knew going in, obviously, but still), and you'll still be going through the same twenty or so event chains until you beg for death. Only now you'll occasionally be checking in on the incredibly ugly and for many people laggy court room, because you have to spend your excess gold on something, even if it's just really boring passive bonuses.\n\nIt is profoundly offensive to offer this DLC for 30 USD when I've seen modders do much more with less time and fewer resources for free. The amount of content on offer here is like, maybe ten dollars worth, and even then I'd still regret buying it when mods will do more for free. This wraps up all of the content you get for the royal edition, and I'll admit I'm a total rube and part of the problem for purchasing that edition of the game. I haven't pre-ordered anything in years, and I made an exception for Crusader Kings because the second game is just that special to me.

The fact they came free is a decent bandaid, the paid mechanics are not. The artifact system and the RPG-esque equipping system look good, but the artifacts themselves are less impressive and feel less earned than artifacts acquired in the predecessor. They give marginal bonuses and due to the sheer quantity of them you acquire, there's no sentiment or real incentive to keep a hold of them. In CK2 if you gained or lost an artifact, it felt good due to the RNG aspect of it or especially bad since there was no easy way to get it back once it was taken from you. In CK3, you can see plainly the purpose of the artifact system: a money sink. It's something for a player who inevitably snowballed due to the easiness of the game to spend money on once they became too big to collapse. The same goes for the court system. Whilst it gives you means to help tidy up your realm and become stronger thanks to some of the milestones for achieving certain levels of grandeur, it's something you're not really involved in beyond spending a pittance per month to increase the quality of clothing and food - which, by the way, gives no visual improvement to the courtroom itself - and after some years in-game, you gain some modifier bonuses to your realm. That's it. The court system feels isolated from the rest of the game in a way, and that probably gives some insight into how future DLCs will function. For example, you gain nothing by having the prior flavor pack, since the Norse don't get any unique visuals for their court once you achieve kingdom rank. Also, locking it to kingdom rank and above guts any potential for competing with your own liege for a grander court, which could have delegitimized them in the eyes of their subjects and given you a claim on their title. The game is lacking in little touches like that all throughout, and this new DLC only added a handful of events to give more life to your game.\n\nI wouldn't recommend purchasing this, even if it was 10 dollars cheaper.

"review": "I have now tried this DLC for quite a few hours.\nI'm sad to say, that i really can't recommend this DLC, when it cost 30 euros. Price sets expectations, and this really shouldn't cost more than 10 euros at the maximum no matter how i see it.\n\nI have over the years bought pretty much every single Paradox DLC on day one, but over the last few years i just keep getting disappointed. They release half baked DLC with barely any features, and still demand 20-30 euros for them. I really can't support this anymore, since i no longer see an actual value in it, and would rather just keep playing on the previous versions to avoid any mishaps the new DLC and update brings.\n\nThe features of this DLC(and update) are the cultures and court.\nLets start with the court.\n\nIt's an extremely barebone 3D court that just gives you a few events and a few spaces to put down some artifacts, that gives a few modifiers. That's basicly it. The court is really ugly and seems like no effort has been put into it, which is a huge disappointment for a main feature of a 30 euro DLC. You get new court positions... that are just more modifiers, and hf appointing people to them whenever the old ones they were assigned to, dies or are otherwise indisposed.\nThe artifacts are just modifiers that are honestly really boring. Again it feels like no effort has been put into it.\n\nThe cultures seem more interesting. I always like to have options to personalise things in games, and this seems to add a bit to it. The feature seems fine for now, but it's a minor thing that doesn't change much. I like the addition of languages, since they add a little flavour to the game. Honestly can't say much more about it, besides it being a little like making your own religion.\n\nSo in the end i can't recommend this, unless you get it on a large discount. I'm sad to see this as the first expansion, since it feels like theres so much they can focus on in the game, to improve it so we can keep enjoying it. But this expansion is just a hollow sideshow that doesn't actually improve on the actual game, but is way more of a minigame inside a game.", "timestamp_created": 1644421148, "timestamp_updated": 1644421148, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109858572": {"recommendationid": "109858572", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004948615", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "tchinese", "review": "\u521d\u5b8c\u611f\u60f3:\n\n\u5dee\u8a55.\n\u75db\u82e6\u592a\u591a\u6536\u7a6b\u592a\u5c11.\n\n\u88dd\u4e86\u65b0DLC\u5f8c\n\u820a\u5b58\u6a94\u5df2\u6709\u89d2\u8272\u8207NPC\u975e\u5e38\u5bb9\u6613\u6b7b,\n\u5c0f\u5b69\u751f\u6c92\u5e7e\u5e74\u5c31\u6b7b\u5149,\n\u73a9\u5bb6\u7684\u5bb6\u65cf\u6210\u54e1\u4e5f\u662f\u72c2\u6b7b,\n\u5bae\u5ef7\u8077\u4f4d\u4e00\u5806,\n\u6307\u6d3eNPC\u4efb\u8077\u5f8c\u4e00\u76f4\u72c2\u6b7b\u53c8\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u6307\u6d3e,\n\u6b7b\u5230\u6c92\u5ef7\u81e3\u7c21\u76f4\u597d\u7b11.\n\n\u5bae\u5ef7\u548c\u5bf6\u7269\u7cfb\u7d71\u592a\u82b1\u9322,\n\u904a\u6232\u6c92\u73a9\u500b\u4e00\u767e\u5e74\u662f\u6c92\u9322\u53bb\u73a9\u88fd\u4f5c\u5bf6\u7269\u7684,\n\u5bae\u5ef7\u671f\u671b\u7b49\u7d1a\u4e5f\u662f\u9ed1\u6d1e,\n\u5c07\u9818\u571f\u64f4\u5f35\u592a\u5927\u5f8c,\n\u8cfa\u7684\u9322\u6839\u672c\u88dc\u4e0d\u4e0a\u82b1\u5728\u5bae\u5ef7\u5f85\u9047\u4f86\u589e\u52a0\u5bae\u5ef7\u7b49\u7d1a\u7684\u8cbb\u7528,\n\u5c0d\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u7684\u5c40\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u624b\u4f86\u8aaa\u975e\u5e38\u7684\u4e0d\u5584.\n\n---------------------------\n\n\u73a9\u4e86\u5169\u5468\u5f8c\u7684\u611f\u60f3:\n\n\u8f49\u597d\u8a55.\n\u5bf6\u7269BUFF\u5f88\u5f37\u5927,\n\u6587\u5316\u7cfb\u7d71\u8b93\u904a\u6232\u66f4\u591a\u8b8a.\n\u8a9e\u8a00\u7cfb\u7d71\u975e\u5e38\u96de\u808b,\n\u611f\u89ba\u4e0d\u592a\u5230\u6709\u4ec0\u9ebc\u4f5c\u7528.\n\n\u8f09\u5165\u820a\u5b58\u6a94\u5f8c\u89d2\u8272\u72c2\u6b7b\u7684BUG\u9084\u662f\u6c92\u4fee\u6b63,\n\u4f46\u5bf6\u7269\u8207\u6587\u5316\u7cfb\u7d71\u5f88\u6709\u8da3,\n\u8490\u96c6\u5168\u8eab\u7684\u540d\u5bb6\u8207\u5353\u8d8a\u7b49\u7d1a\u7684\u5bf6\u7269\u5f8c,\n\u5404\u7a2eBUFF\u5806\u758a\u6839\u672c\u8f15\u9b06\u73a9,\n\u6bcf\u6708\u5bb6\u65cf\u5a01\u671b3\u300140\u90fd\u6c92\u554f\u984c,\n\n\u6587\u5316\u7cfb\u7d71\u4e5f\u8b93\u4e00\u5c40\u5920\u9577\u6642\u9593\u7684\u904a\u6232\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u8b8a\u5316,\n\u8490\u96c6\u5404\u7a2e\u7368\u7279\u5f37\u529b\u6587\u5316\u4f5c\u878d\u5408\u80fd\u8b93\u904a\u6232\u9032\u884c\u66f4\u6709\u8da3,\n\u672a\u4f86\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7368\u6709\u6587\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a8\u51fa.", "timestamp_created": 1644421146, "timestamp_updated": 1645401081, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47826087474822998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109858553": {"recommendationid": "109858553", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022324126", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "french", "review": "Pour ma part ce dlc une tr\u00e8s bonne surprise de mani\u00e8re globale.\n\nPoints n\u00e9g : -

But I can\u2019t be the only one who looks at this clunky UI, new exploits and bugs/AI mishaps still prevalent since launch and ask: is this it? This DLC is a step in the right direction. It makes you interact with characters a lot more than before and that Is what crusader kings is all about. But for $30 the ask is much more than what the DLC actually gives, especially after waiting a whole year after launch (probably spent a longer time in development before launch) when several mods add many of these mechanics albeit not as polished as Royal Court.

Ultimately, I think the Royal Court makes for a successful \"first step\" into what will probably be like a decade of expansions.\n\nThe court stuff really does add a lot - it's not going to completely change your games, and I imagine the events are going to get repetitive, but as something to fiddle with and play around with during the downtime between expansion it's awesome. Snappy interface, and seeing your growing cast of characters all interacting adds more than you would think. Big fan of how they've implemented court positions as well - the two together make for a good moneysink and a nice way to flesh out that big cluster of courtiers you never remember anything about. Particularly women - I found in male-dominated regions, outside of spymaster and court physician, there was never anything to do with your skilled female courtiers, and this solves that problem nicely.\n\nArtifacts are fun, and at least where I am it's not cheap or easy to farm them - in my first run, even after a century I'm only at 50% capacity, and a lot of the items I have gotten are kinda junk. Cultures seem interesting, but it's expensive to diverge, so I haven't messed around with them yet. Have seen some real-world cultures pop up - Tunisian and Kazakh, maybe some others - which is cool. Definitely gives regions an interesting flavor, without railroading things too hard. Tough line to walk but it seems successful.\n\nAll in all, I do think it lives up to the hype - its new systems feel appropriately big and transformative, not just window dressing. I just hope they have the pipeline up and running, because what we have is great, but we're gonna need more of it before it starts to get old again.", "timestamp_created": 1644419729, "timestamp_updated": 1644419729, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109857007": {"recommendationid": "109857007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093185858", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "649.95 PHP is too much, EU4's Origins DLC faired better", "timestamp_created": 1644419527, "timestamp_updated": 1644419527, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.479019075632095337", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109856973": {"recommendationid": "109856973", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987536128", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting content additions but Pdx said that moving forward DLC would be higher price and reflect that in quality.\n\nSorry guys, this content is nice but the game is still relatively new and I think the priorities are all wrong. \nThe culture stuff is magnificent don't get me wrong but most is focussed around a court that is locked to king tier and focuses on visuals and minor bonuses with artifacts. \n\nMeanwhile the game does need deeper mechanics, which is what you would expect early DLC to put effort into. \n\nI enjoy the DLC and culture hybrid, divergence etc is absolutely amazing and I will get plenty out of it but I find the decision to make visual assets and trinkets the first \"major\" expansion absolutely mystifying and I hope they focus on deeper mechanics and issues in future ( looking at you unplayable republics, poor law system and more engaging ways to interact with vassals for troops etc)", "timestamp_created": 1644419496, "timestamp_updated": 1644419496, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614608943462371826", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109856934": {"recommendationid": "109856934", "author": {"steamid": "76561198080495967", "num_games_owned": 106, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "russian", "review": "\u0414\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u043e \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0438-\u0438\u0433\u0440\u0430, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u0435\u0449\u0451 \u0438 \u0434\u043e\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442 \u0432 \u0438\u0433\u0440\u0443 \u0432\u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0447\u0443\u0442\u044c-\u0447\u0443\u0442\u044c \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430. \u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\u044e\u0442\u0441\u044f", "timestamp_created": 1644419448, "timestamp_updated": 1644419448, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527559041976928711", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109856892": {"recommendationid": "109856892", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088164428", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "polish", "review": "Jest gorzej ni\u017c my\u015bla\u0142em.

Not to mention that it opens the door to new ways to mod the game that will only make the game that much better. \n\nThe price is a little high, but as someone who has been playing Paradox games since the days of the original Crusader Kings I always see their prices as investments. Unlike most companies that leave their games buggy messes, Paradox games evolves overtime for years and age like a fine wine. (The only exception being maybe Rome since they can't seem to get Rome games right.)\n\nFor me, buying DLC has always been with the knowledge that this gives Paradox more money to do more great things cause for the most part this company has yet to fall like so many of my other favourite companies.

Die Royal Edition ist im Internet weiterhin (!)legal(!) verf\u00fcgbar und kostet dort mittlerweile weniger als das Addon Royal Court an sich. Das zun\u00e4chst einmal dazu. Zum Addon an und f\u00fcr sich muss ich sagen, dass ich das Spiel auf Englisch spiele, mir deshalb noch keine \u00dcbersetzungsfehler aufgefallen sind, nat\u00fcrlich. Das w\u00e4re aber auch das allerletzte, was ich einem Spiel als Fehler ankreiden w\u00fcrde. Man muss leider sagen, \u00dcbersetzungen stehen nat\u00fcrlich ganz weit unten auf der Priorit\u00e4tsliste. \n\nIch will auch nicht darauf eingehen, was die neuen Features sind, da die bei diversen Presseorganen und Paradox selbst hinreichend erkl\u00e4rt wurden. Ich muss allerdings meine Entt\u00e4uschung zur Kenntnis geben, dass das Addon so ver\u00f6ffentlich wurde. Heruntergebrochen w\u00fcrde ich sagen, gibt es 3 S\u00e4ulen des Addons: 1. Artefacte, die ganz nett sein k\u00f6nnen, da sie diverse Boni bieten und u.a. auch Kriegsgr\u00fcnde liefern k\u00f6nnen, 2. der Thronsaal, ein 3D Raum, wo im Moment noch nicht wirklich viel Action ist und 3. Sprachen und Kulturen ver\u00e4ndern, was man aber sich auch erst einmal leisten k\u00f6nnen muss, wenn man bedenkt, dass selbst kleine \u00c4nderungen (1 Slot) min. 3000 bis 4000 Prestige kosten. \n\nAls Fazit muss ich leider sagen, dass ich 30 Euro f\u00fcr das Addon als deutlich zu viel ansehe. Ich bin froh, seinerzeit die Royal Edition gekauft zu haben, ich w\u00fc\u00dfte nicht, ob ich Royal Court nicht wieder retounieren w\u00fcrde, wenn ich es mir hier so gekauft h\u00e4tte.

It is acceptable. I were not disappointed since I had low expectations. For people with Royal Edition, is Royal Court worth 30 euro? No. 20 euro? No. 15 euro? Yes. In other words wait for sale.\n\nI have seen people comparing this to Witcher 3 Blood & Wine DLC price. Royal Court doesn't justify the price, unlike Blood & Wine; that is just the sad reality.\n\nHowever, I recommend Royal Court to roleplaying enthusiasts who love to have a throne room, upgrade the amenities of your court and appoint courtiers and nobles to prestigious positions of your court. Don't expect it to be \"the Sims\" in the middle ages. You can't pick the wallpaper color or carpet, but you can display banners, furs and artifacts you have gotten through looting or crafting.\n\nHolding court is done through events; you still choose between different answers to interact with your vassals and courtiers. There are no 3D models moving up to you and bowing, kneeling or kowtowing, if that is what you were hoping for. \n\nMost of the new events come from holding court or interacting with your liege's court. I have only done one playthrough, so I can't say if there are many new events for outside of holding court.\n\nAt the time of this review; equipping gear on yourself doesn't show on your 3D model, it just gives stat boosts to yourself (weapons give prowess), prestige and renown.\n\nI can see this being fun the first few playthroughs, but it will get stale pretty fast once you have discovered all the mechanics. \n\nCulture mechanics has gotten an upgrade. You can now customize your culture in several different ways: You can create a hybrid culture or diverge from the original culture. Paradox has given us a lot of options to tweak our culture with different traditions, heritage and cultural pillars. There are too many to list, but last I counted there were at least 30+ different culture traditions you can customize your culture with. You can, for example, create a warrior culture, spiritual culture, bureaucratic culture or meritocracy. Or mix the many different traditions into one crazy culture.\n\nConclusion: Steer away from Royal Court if you are not a roleplayer. Even if you are one, don't buy it until it has at least 50% discount. For those who got the cash to burn and are roleplayers: It is decent.

The characters don't do anything but stand around.  There is no way to move around the room, and if you click on the characters, you just get the usual pop up window about them.  The most of the other enhancements of the DLC feel minor and do not justify the price of the DLC.

Given how long it took PDX to make this relative to other DLCs, I could understand the price if they put A LOT more content in it, and it quite surprises me that they didn\u2019t, given the development length. It is not a game-compromising expansion (wink wink Leviathan) and the stuff that it has is quite good. Buy it at a 50% sale. I think that given all of the facts, this game\u2019s dev team is getting the short end of the stick, and I regret my role in supporting that, especially when this game has such potential.

This is not really adjustable and immersion breaking. If you are holding court, you need to stop game, because outside things still happen, even pop ups can occure and you can't proper handle them.\n\n2) You can individualisze your culture ingame. This can also give you some decent bonuses. Some cultures already have good bonuses, so you can simply switch your culture and then there isn't that big of a need for creating your own. PDX lets you sniff on what you don't have in the free version. But you won't miss the mixing or creation of an own culture, because it is an idea, good for a game like Imperator Rome (maybe they had the idea there and because of stopping development they added it in CK3, because the DLC itself is really scarce even with this \"feature\".\n\n3) You get some court jobs more than the free version.\n\nThis is what you get and everything else, what people are talking about, is part of the free update.\n\nAfter reaching first achievements:\n\nGot the first achievements and the \"style\" is either 20 years old, or it only shows how less they care about how ugly it looks. Overall it feels like they already sold so many copies of the Royal Edition that nobody could get the money back and they already \"earned\" it, so why any more effort than the bare minimum.\n\nOriginal comment:\n\nDon't ask if it is the needed free update coming along with this or the DLC itself. Game isn't running smooth any more. Multiplayer doesn't work proper because you get logged out from PDX (yes you need to be logged in to PDX to play Multiplayer - the dumbest thing ever, because we use Steam to not being forced to log in somewhere else) randomly during multiplayer sessions. It happens every couple minutes.\n\nMany stutter while in court. You get declared ware and while you get attacked the court room opens up, so you can't call your army or so, first need to close this thing again.\n\nIf you pay 30 bucks for it, it is worth 10! Maximum! What you get is, what you mostly know from CK2, just with beautier graphics.

CK2 was a wonderful game but it was hard to ever see my character as a living, breathing person. Royal Court adding the ability to see them in an actual space was wonderful.\n\nThe return of Artifacts is wonderful, especially with the new interface for slotting them in. It's a thousand times easier to see what you have equipped and what it does now than in CK2, a real masterclass in how to take a base feature everyone liked and make it even better in a sequel. The combination of Royal Courts and Artifacts also makes for some of the most gorgeous things in the game, the Court Artifacts are splendorous things - wonderful tapestries, excellently-designed boxes that bleed a living medieval feeling, that communicate the life and vivacity of the period.\n\nOn top of that, the biggest thing that EVERYONE interacts with is the cultural revamp - culture was already a fairly interesting and new thing compared to the nothingness it was in CK2, but now every culture is encouraged to play differently - a Dutch player will focus on making money, Saxons on conquest, et cetera et cetera. What's more, if you want to revamp your base culture, hybridization lets you put together the best of both cultures, so that instead of a genocidal maniac, you might actually play like a decent monarch (Though be honest, most of the playerbase will still probably wipe out the other cultures.) \n\nOf course, the main downside is the pricetag. $30 is a hell of a lot for a DLC, even one this major. I could even see $25 at a stretch, but $30 is putting the toe across the line. I'm recommending the game based mostly on the actual content- it makes picking this up definitely worthwhile, but if you don't have a lot of cash to burn, wait for a sale.", "timestamp_created": 1644409678, "timestamp_updated": 1644409678, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109848397": {"recommendationid": "109848397", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096831324", "num_games_owned": 382, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "RNM \u542c\u5230\u6ca1 RNM\n", "timestamp_created": 1644409596, "timestamp_updated": 1644409596, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109848366": {"recommendationid": "109848366", "author": {"steamid": "76561198136029781", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "thai", "review": "10/10 Fun as fuck........", "timestamp_created": 1644409556, "timestamp_updated": 1644409556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109848360": {"recommendationid": "109848360", "author": {"steamid": "76561198999287693", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u52a0\u5f3a\u4f53\u9a8c\u611f\u4f46\u540e\u671f\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u73a9\u5bb6\u65e0\u654c\u662f\u673a\u5236\u548cai\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "timestamp_created": 1644409552, "timestamp_updated": 1644409552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109848341": {"recommendationid": "109848341", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129951447", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "oh hell no, not worth the 30 euro's.

The new features they have added to the game really enrich the experience. The new culture system revamps what felt like a outdated system when compared to the religious one. Cultures really do feel unique rather than just the technological difference from before now certain tenets of a culture grant stat bonuses,events and even languages which you can learn to make other cultures like you a bit more. Hybridizing with new cultures and diverging feels rewarding and really adds to the roleplaying and storytelling potential of the game. This is easily the best feature of this DLC.\n\nThe new court is great from both a artistic and gameplay perspective it gives a ton more content when playing as both a vassal and a liege. You can now directly petition your liege for things and have your vassals do the same to you. This really improves the roleplay in the game, pulling the player out of the map screen and into the 3D court room makes these interactions feel far more personal. I actually tend to remember these and when a certain vassal consistently annoys me or when my liege refuses my requests it makes you want to screw them over when the opportunity arises.\n\nThe only major issue with the DLC is the price. There is a ton of content here and it's content that will impact your game regardless of where you play on the map (unlike the single culture focused flavor packs) and it's far bigger than any of the individual expansions for CK2 were, but even then the 30 dollar price tag really is a bit steep and it stains a otherwise perfect expansion, however I would still recommend it because I truly do think it's still worth money due to the huge improvement on the game that it makes.

about 45 euros with the 3 future DLCs bundled in, otherwise I'd feel more bitter about this first \"major\" expansion for CK3 if i paid more.\n\nIt brings back the inventory system and artifacts which is nice to see again and now there's a 3D court you get to see and even fill with things you earned, minor titles are also back and more interesting and fleshed out unlike in CK2 where all they did was just get you 10+ opinion for a character and there's also the culture stuff that was expanded which is cool  but the culture stuff hasn't been all that super exciting for me personally, mainly what happens now is you end up forming mega hybrid cultures that just gets more and more out of hand as you play.\n\nOverall it's just kinda lack luster for the asking price, like the content it self

( that alone is a do not recommend )  It's $42.95 in AUD \n\nReview for the actual content. \n\nThe court system,\nAll the court system is gameplay wise, is a money sink to get extra prestige and renown with some random events thrown in. Why is it a money sink? with the new court you have to spend upkeep to up the grandeur of your court, if your court is below the grandeur of other courts around you, you lose ticking prestige, the upkeep isn't to expensive but early game it will chunk your money a decent bit. \n\nThe inventory and equipment that I've seen so far is mostly just more extra prestige, renown and prowess aka mostly stats that don't matter really. \n\nNow you're sitting here like that actually sounds pretty good if you wanted to do a tribal run, well NOPE tribals don't get courts so I guess F tribals. You do still get inventory / equipment though so when you do eventually swap to feudal you can spice up your court ( but honestly you should have a court from the get go though ofc smaller) \n\nCulture Update, Honestly it just boils down for a way to skip innovations as a tribal so you can go feudal faster so you can actually use the court. \nFor the most part the culture hybrid is nice to just get rid of shitty traditions for the obviously better ones and if you like hey that just sounds like reforming your faith you'd be 100% correct, that's all there is to it. \n\n( calling it now there gonna be some youtube video about how OP norse / greek combo is, greek will all the innovations and a bunch of traditions that lower M@A upkeep and norse with their OP M@A yep just gonna steamroll everyone ) \n\nHonestly the most slept on part ( though I don't believe it's apart of the dlc just the free patch but that is the Coat of Arms designer, you can now design your house, count, duke, kingdom and empire coat of arms at ANY point in the game, you can also change your factions colour which is nice) \n\n\nIf you read all this and think yeah that's just what I want, just get the game edition that adds the dlc's ( the season pass or royal edition what ever they're calling it, it's much cheaper)", "timestamp_created": 1644401515, "timestamp_updated": 1644401515, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547537028789520264", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109842722": {"recommendationid": "109842722", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049781668", "num_games_owned": 164, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "A little on the pricier side for sure, but the content is really fun and adds a lot to the game.

Il y a de nouvelles musiques, de nouveaux portraits, les visages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retravaill\u00e9s, les cultures aussi, et j'oublie \u00e9norm\u00e9ment de fonctionnalit\u00e9s, je ne cite que ce qui m'a marqu\u00e9. Le principe de la Cour Royale est excellent : Quel plaisir de pouvoir enfin, agir en v\u00e9ritable souverain ! Malheureusement, et c'est l\u00e0 une premi\u00e8re d\u00e9ception pour moi, la cour Royale n'est disponible que pour les Rois et Empereurs. Je trouve \u00e7a dommage, car c'est v\u00e9ritablement une fonctionnalit\u00e9 agr\u00e9able, et on a pas toujours la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00eatre roi ou Empereur dans une partie (Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 sympathique de l'avoir pour les ducs ind\u00e9pendants, style petits royaumes irlandais, et \u00e7a aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 logique. Certains gros ducs, comme le duc de Normandie en France, etc...). Ce qui fait qu'on retombe, en cons\u00e9quence, dans les boucles de gameplay habituelles de crusader Kings. Autre probl\u00e8me de la cour royale : La r\u00e9p\u00e9titivit\u00e9. J'y ai jou\u00e9 environ 2h30, et je retombe d\u00e9j\u00e0 sur les m\u00eames probl\u00e8mes lors de mes audiences (J'en ai fait quoi, 3 - 4 ?). C'est dommage, parce qu'\u00e0 long terme, les audiences vont perdre \u00e9norm\u00e9ment en int\u00e9r\u00eat.\nVos vassaux, vos courtisans peuvent venir vous voir pour r\u00e9gler leurs diff\u00e9rents, l\u00e0 dessus rien \u00e0 dire, c'est vari\u00e9 et sympathique. On peut aussi r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer un territoire de jure par la diplomatie (Quelle Chance !), utile quand on est pas un va en guerre. En ce qui concerne les Artefacts, peut-\u00eatre suis-je dur, mais je trouve qu'il y a trop de propositions pour en cr\u00e9er. Ce n'est pas assez rare si vous voulez. Le principe des langues que l'on peut apprendre est sympathique, \u00e7a rajoute un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \"RP\". Mais, petit probl\u00e8me selon moi : On a pas moyen de savoir quelle langue est parl\u00e9e ou. On peut savoir quelle langue est la langue des courts voisines, mais on ne peut savoir quelle langue est parl\u00e9e dans les comt\u00e9s, les duch\u00e9s... Je trouve \u00e7a vraiment dommage, car \u00e7a att\u00e9nue grandement ce sentiment de \"Multiculturalit\u00e9\" de nos royaumes et empires, un comble pour une maj qui cherche pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e0 nous donner ce sentiment, via la refonte des cultures. \n\n        Quel est le rapport qualit\u00e9 prix de ce DLC, d\u00e9sormais ? Grande question. Il est ind\u00e9niable que les d\u00e9veloppeurs ont beaucoup travaill\u00e9 dessus. La cour Royale est splendide, c'est une petite r\u00e9volution et sans doute, est-ce l\u00e0 une raison de son prix. Mais je ne peux m'emp\u00eacher de penser que 30 euros, c'est excessif. 30 euros, c'est le prix d'un jeu, voir m\u00eame plusieurs. Or, ici, pour 30 euros, vous avez acc\u00e8s \u00e0 d'excellentes fonctionnalit\u00e9s, certes mais des fonctionnalit\u00e9s finalement bien l\u00e9g\u00e8res et tr\u00e8s g\u00e9n\u00e9rales (C'est du mieux un peu ici, un peu l\u00e0, mais il n'y a pas de v\u00e9ritable transformation du gameplay, la court royale apporte un suppl\u00e9ment vraiment bienvenu mais peut-\u00eatre un peu, disons, l\u00e9ger ?).  La mise \u00e0 jour gratuite qui accompagne le DLC est superbe, dans l'ensemble on ne peut qu'\u00eatre satisfait. Mais \u00e7a reste cher pay\u00e9. Je pense que 20 euros aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un prix plus correct (20 euros, le prix d'un gros DLC de Stellaris pour ceux qui connaissent...). Je ne peux n\u00e9anmoins que vous le recommander, car m\u00eame si je suis tr\u00e8s critique envers cette extension j'en suis satisfait. Mais si vous pouvez, attendez les r\u00e9ductions.\n\nEDIT : Les devs on rajout\u00e9 la court royale pour les gouvernements tribaux ! Cela, sans compter quelques autres ajouts en termes d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements...

What you pay for what you get, is terrible value. Terrible.\n\nI love the game, love the genre and have a ton of hours played in a multitude of games from conquer everything to roleplaying a characters traits and everything in between. Oh the content that is there is great and it adds more events and another layer to the game but, again, the cost of the DLC for what you get is not worth the price tag.\n\nYou're spoon fed... 'We're giving you this awesome free patch! With all this stuff.' Reality is that it is a patch. A patch to fix bugs and issues, not free content. It was coming anyway. In fact, if anything, they are making fundamental changes to the game so they can then add content that they can charge for and disguising half of it as a free patch for everyone to make them seem like they're doing you a favour. It and they are really not.\n\n So after all the great free patch content you get we then move on to the content that you need to pay for in 'Royal Court'. What is there is very welcome and does add another layer to the game but there is simply not enough meat on the bone to justify the price tag. The royal court can only be accessed by Feudal Kingdom and above and whilst that in itself isn't a bad thing and I have no issue with it, there perhaps should be, for the asking price, a lower different option for Pagan's. Maybe a less involved tribal tent or longhouse or something with different options but something to give you the feel of staying in that lane. This is purely based on the asking price and what we were sold.... 'more grander content less frequently.' Royal Court is just lacking that grandness. In spades.\n\n End of the day, I'm a sucker and have happily paid for the extra things that are there because I love the game and I know I've gotten my value out of what i've paid tenfold but it still doesnt make it right. For the asking price, there should be a lot more to show for it.\n\nNegative review.", "timestamp_created": 1644398674, "timestamp_updated": 1644398674, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2,

Royal court succeeds in making ck3 more fun to play, but that is where its success ends. Royal court adds very little content and none of it brings any meaningful changes to how you play ck3. Culture sees the most notable improvement and brings some solid RP mechanics, even if it only really manifests as additional opinion modifiers. The new events are much welcome but they don't alter the gameplay loop at all and the same events appear far too frequently, just like when the game launched. Intrigue is simultaneously the most useful character focus while remaining the most frustrating, since it ensures you'll get a notification once a month that some random countess is humping her court bishop, or that your marshal had a random courtier assassinated 20 years before your current character was even born. The court visualizer was a promising feature, but it feels like they dedicated far too many resources to visualize something that could have been portrayed just as well with 2d artwork and some descriptive text. Nothing has been done to address the incompetent AI, but at least I know Kaiser Henry the fourth has a \"stinky court.\"\n\nSpeaking on more than just the DLC's additions, ck3 does a very poor job of simulating any government type other than feudal, and even then their feudal government type is applied far too broadly. The expansion introduces no unique administration systems for the ERE or the (non-existent) nomads, nor does it offer a proper iqta or republic rework. Republics remain nonfactors and are still not playable. In my 300+ hours since launch I have not once seen a republic such as venice or pisa attempt to expand their realm. Compared to its most recent predecessor, ck3 still stale and predictable, especially after your first 50-80 years as a ruler. Regardless of your ruleset, the AI is incredibly passive and the only challenge for someone that is familiar with the game's mechanics comes in the form of arbitrary law/succession restrictions that bring no meaningful difficulty and just makes new playthroughs feel like a slog as you wait 200+ years to institute primogeniture. Mongols are still the only plausible challenge you'll face after your first 3-4 rulers, but from my experience they still collapse before stretching beyond the Caspian.\n\nI'm having some fun with my current playthrough, but once I wrap that up, ck2 with HIP will remain my preferred way to play crusader kings.", "timestamp_created": 1644397969, "timestamp_updated": 1644397969, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488457053899765015", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109840256": {"recommendationid": "109840256", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124420167", "num_games_owned": 240, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "CK3\u90fd\u67093D\u5bab\u5ef7\u4e86\uff0c\u4ec0\u4e48\u65f6\u5019\u7ed9\u7fa4\u661f\u4e5f\u4e0a\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u89c2\u89c2\u5bdf\u661f\u7403\u5185\u90e8\u57ce\u5e02\u5e03\u5c40\u5efa\u8bbe\u7684UI\uff08\uff09", "timestamp_created": 1644397866, "timestamp_updated": 1644397866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498595535755157471", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109840252": {"recommendationid": "109840252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044014484", "num_games_owned": 210, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "One!

For a part of the community, this gives the impression of playing a game in a rather unrealistic dull environment. Yes, CKIII with all its plots, etc. is freaking dull in my opinion. \n\nThe events end to be all the same, there is no big differences playing one culture or another except for a few min-max % modifiers in whatever category you won\u2019t care about, same for religions. You\u2019re spending renown, faith or whatever for reasons you don\u2019t quite understand.\n\nExamples:\n-\tIn this expansion you are given the possibility to diverge your culture. In place of having a compelling dynamic way of seeing cultures emerge and being mixed up together (being dynamically created) it\u2019s in the player power to diverge the culture of a whole country. \n-\tAnother example: there is no link between the artifacts you have and the possibility to wear it in the barbershop. So, if you want to put your papal tiara on without possessing it well, go ahead. What\u2019s the point of trying to gain those artifacts only for their modifiers?...\n-\tYou can improve the splendor of your court, etc. But for what? Again, a few min-max modifiers? What\u2019s the point? \n\nBy trying to be as sandboxy as possible to please a certain crowd, paradox is losing its way with players that want to play a simulation, where things happen organically. For a certain crowd here, the fun seems to lie in creating weird faiths, playing with nude characters or be as incestuous as possible. I wanted to give another point of view from the part of the community that would like paradox to go back to simulation games, with realistic thriving stories dynamically happening in the game and less player control.\n\nAnyway.

muito tempo para sair, mas o conte\u00fado n\u00e3o \u00e9, em nada, maior que as DLCs antigas de CK2, EU4 e outros jogos mais antigos, certamente n\u00e3o justifica o pre\u00e7o de 60 reais em compara\u00e7\u00e3o as demais.\n\nSobre a DLC, seus focos principais s\u00e3o:\n-O sistema de corte, que ignorando a parte in\u00fatil do 3D cria novas formas de se gastar dinheiro para obter alguns bonus, e alguns eventos adicionais.\n-Um sistema de equipamentos, que j\u00e1 existia no CK2\n-Um novo sistema de cultura, onde a mesma tem grandes efeitos nas habilidades de cada personagem, suas tend\u00eancias, e at\u00e9 valores culturais al\u00e9m dos religiosos.\n\nApenas a parte da cultura, na minha opini\u00e3o, adiciona algo de grande relev\u00e2ncia para a gameplay, como falei, \u00e9 legal, \u00e9 melhor ter a DLC do que n\u00e3o ter a DLC, mas se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o tem pressa compre nas promo\u00e7\u00f5es.", "timestamp_created": 1644395606, "timestamp_updated": 1644395606,

However it also makes success in your dynasty that much more rewarding. As of the many new extra events they've included so far i haven't seen too many but the ones that i have seen are pretty interesting, i have also only done one play-through as the count of Wien so possibly expanding your religious and cultural differences would help with finding more new events. But as for the good stuff. Once my count finally reached the king of Germany the amount of new things i could do was pretty impressive and you could tell that they spent a lot of work on the 3D models.

Au moins, le prix aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pleinement justifi\u00e9 et les consommateurs auraient compris qu'ils paient aussi, quelque part, pour cette maj qui change beaucoup de choses. C'est une forme de redistribution en somme.\n\nPour se focaliser sur le DLC en lui-m\u00eame, celui-ci ajoute quand m\u00eame pas mal de choses : un grand nombre d'\u00e9v\u00e8nements et de possibilit\u00e9s de gameplay pour les rois/empereurs et leurs vassaux. Bien s\u00fbr, cela renforce leur pouvoir, mais cela nous renvoie \u00e0 une certaine r\u00e9alit\u00e9 (bien que je pense qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de l'\u00e9tendre aux ducs ind\u00e9pendants). Mais cela apporte avant tout de nouvelles possibilit\u00e9s dans une phase (mid/late game) o\u00f9 le jeu pouvait commencer \u00e0 s'essouffler et o\u00f9 il ne restait souvent plus qu'\u00e0 blober ses voisins.

It may have taken Paradox longer to develop, but thus far I have found it to be well worth the wait, especially within the framework of remote development due to COVID.

This DLC in some parts - language, for instance - can be lacklustre. But where the DLC matters, the court and culture overhauls, it blows expectations out of the water.\n\nI played the game nonstop from when Royal Court released (10 to 5pm) up until around half 2am nonstop because I found it so enjoyable. The AI utilising the features in the expansion is very nice to see, especially the new culture mechanics. In one game I saw a Han count form Tibet and create a Han-Tibetan culture. The AI can and will use these mechanics flawlessly.\nThe royal court itself is a really fun feature and I completely disagree with what others have been saying of it. I don't believe it gets boring at all, I loved creating a long lasting legacy in my court with artifacts and an ever increasing court grandeur. It follows the story of your dynasty and suppliments it in really unique ways that the game is richer for.\n\nSo yes, some things aren't as developed as they should be, but this is just a fact of life in the covid-lockdown era world of game development. The parts that are developed fully are done with so much attention and care that it easily hides the parts with less polish.\n\nI cannot recommend this expansion enough.", "timestamp_created": 1644380114, "timestamp_updated": 1644380114, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.478278189897537231", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109829470": {"recommendationid": "109829470", "author": {"steamid": "76561198865086383", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "V3\u51fa\u4e86\u518d\u6539\u597d\u8bc4", "timestamp_created": 1644379991, "timestamp_updated": 1644379991, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.458039700984954834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109829446": {"recommendationid": "109829446", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202023932", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "For clarification why i'm giving this a harsher review you can see my base game Crusader Kings l l l Review (!,600+ Hours Negative)\n\nWell, After much overhyping and delays after delays with no information and them finally giving us a date before December can say now that i was right in my original judgement. The \"Massive Update\" is something you can binge in under 8 hours they put all of their eggs in the new court system that half the time does not function as intended. During this update they seriously screwed something up all old saves NPCS dropping like flies and in new game they did something to character generation as many look like Abominations against God whom will soon suffer the Lords Wrath in the upcoming Crusade. Having said that, The court system is admittedly interesting. When it does work it is pretty neat but majority of time it just looks derpy as all hell. I regret buying this game on day one with Royal Edition in the future i'd advise others to wait for DLC to actually come out and be covered properly before buying from this particular team at Paradox. Its been 11 hours since release and even people on Vanilla are crashing to Desktop because a music file is incorrectly pathed. The playerbase found the issue within hours and yet devs still do nothing. \n\nThe upside to this DLC? LL will finally get some adult mods\n\nDownside? Broke almost every single mod so if it isn't newer than February 8th you will very likely not be able to use it. The Vanilla game crashes constantly to Musicfile_1 and when that is disabled it will still randomly crash when it feels like. Now, Before you say \"Upgrade your pc\" my PC is well above minimum requirement it can run New World with zero issues and X4 Foundations which is notoriously Memory Intensive with no issues for prolonged times. Very Incompetent Dev Team.\n\nIf you play Vanilla Exclusively for obvious reasons you'll want this DLC once they fix all the little hiccups if indeed they ever do which looking back at their activity i'd  suggest getting ready to wait A LONG TIME. Meanwhile, Mod community will have it fixed within a week.\n\nIf you use mods? Wait for a sale it doesn't add enough content to justify anything here they re-added A LOT of content from Crusader Kings l l while keeping many mechanics broken such as crusades & still ZERO content for off map powers & Nomads. Very Disappointed Paradox hire a new Dev Team please.\n\nAlso, To Moderator that banned me months ago cause he didn't like me calling them out.\n\nEnjoy being constantly harassed by the Community again.\nYou truly deserve it.", "timestamp_created": 1644379960, "timestamp_updated": 1644380171, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554256260395050049", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109829436": {"recommendationid": "109829436", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101907677", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5e78\u4e8f\u6211\u6700\u5f00\u59cb\u4e70\u7684\u5b63\u7968\u5305\uff0c\u8fd9dlc\u5355\u4e70\u6211\u89c9\u5f97\u4e0d\u503c\u5f97", "timestamp_created": 1644379946, "timestamp_updated": 1644379946, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109829390": {"recommendationid": "109829390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040968595", "num_games_owned": 101, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Firstly, i can understand everyones frustration with how long the dlc took, and with how much they felt it needed to provide in order to be worth the 30$.\n\nThat being said this dlc provides quite a bit in my opinion.\n\nThe throne room is a cool cosmetic touch, and provides some cool places to store items you create or plunder from raids ( they brought a form of artifacts back from ck2!). It even allows you to increase different levels of food provided, servants, decorations etc. all of which benefit you by providing positive opinion boost to your courtiers and vassals. My favorite part, however, is that it allows a really cool interaction menu between you and your vassals, or even you and your ruler that i believe was missing. You can now ask your ruler for help against another vassal, or in a war that you're losing. You can have your ruler send men to help increase your control in a country you just conquered etc etc.\n\nThrone room aside, the dlc provides a super interesting language \"barrier\" if you will now and a huge increase in the cultural significance of the gameplay. Each culture starts with a set language that they speak and if you learn their language (locked at 2 foreign languages to start with more as perks) then they increase opinion of you, which can help you if you decide to make a pairing of your culture and theirs which is in my opinion the best part of the mod. No longer do you have to rule a french people for 500 years and slowly convert them to norse/pagan. You can allow yourself and your people to become one in the same as a Norse-French Culture hybrid (or whatever you decide you want.\n\nThis mod adds alot to the game, other then just the throne room that everyone is upset about.", "timestamp_created": 1644379875, "timestamp_updated": 1644379875, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109829356": {"recommendationid": "109829356", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095941736", "num_games_owned": 1304, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Not a horrible DLC just overpriced for a series of mechanics that I think were a set of good additions, The culture system is a good continuation of the modular elements similar to religion in the base game. Ultimately I think all the added features should all be part of the base game to enable later changes and prevent a similar state to Europa Universalis IV: where mechanics are ultimately very shallow as mechanics exclusive to certain DLCs cant interact with other DLCs as an individual player may not own others. While things like Bloodlines from CK2 for instance can be very disconnected, its kind of stupid for say EU4 previously having province and ages development being locked behind DLC.\n\nGiven the development time and effort its easy to understand why Paradox would see it being worth so much, a 3D element for the court is a large commitment for the developers and a bit different to the usual Paradox grand strategy games. Compared to the Flavor Pack for the Norse I honestly think that 'Expansions' is a poorer way to implement features and a focus should be placed on the packs to enrich regional gameplay for, at least, the major culture groups that are played.\n\nOverall just a very high price and long wait for some admittedly fun mechanics but it could be a spiral of locking away new mechanics behind large paywalls. I would honestly prefer a stream of Flavor Packs for different cultures (might have to group up some less played ones into groups either together or with a big seller that would command the expansion price tag i.e Mongol/Steppe group pack, Ethiopian/East Africa pack, India Pack?).

Which leads to another problem: this feature is only useful if you are a kingdom or an empire.\n2. Artifacts. This feature is definitely cool and has some great uses. You can buy them, find them, fund their creation, or steal them. Then you can equip them, maintain them, and display them in your court. It's fairly engaging.\n3. The new culture system. It's an amazing system, however it simply doesn't get much use. They definitely put a lot of time into it, but how often am I going to diverge or merge my cultures in a playthrough? Maybe two or three times? It simply isn't very engaging. \n\nSo overall all the features are good, but they don't change gameplay enough to warrant a $30 price tag. $20 would be the right amount for this update.\n\nAnd the game is severely lacking in event diversity. Events tend to repeat over time, to the point that I basically just click through them. The game needs a lot more events, and what would be especially great is regional events, religious, and cultural events. I think those exist right now, but in very small numbers.

Reason for the positive is that the actual content of the DLC is not, on the whole, *bad*.\n\nWhat comes with the DLC is the 3d court background for Kings and Emperors (with restrictions), and a way to tailor a culture all for yourself (which costs thousands of prestige). Artifacts are reintroduced, to be displayed at court or 'worn' in a personal inventory. \n\nAnd those things are fine. You have a 3d static background for some events instead of a 2d static background. The cultures are interesting in a min/max kind of way and if you ever have a few thousand prestige spare on a ruler then might make for some fun. The events themselves are, generally, well written but have the unfortunate habit of repeating very, very frequently to the point where you wonder if there are only a few of them just constantly cycling through. \n\nSo this is generally fine. This is not bad. Slim pickings in places but clearly a platform for more content from someone some time in the future.\n\nMy problem with it is that it's all tailored towards a very specific part of the map and a playstyle which will use those things. And the repetitive nature of events at court (whether as vassal or liege) rapidly leads to me not even noticing the 3d static background in order to scan the text box in the corner of the screen to see if it's something I've already made a decision on several times prior for that particular ruler. It feels pinched. That may be a result of the free update which accompanies this DLC, but it does leave me going back to my old policy of only buying Paradox games and DLC on deep sales.\n\nThis review is positive because the content is not *bad*. Whether there's value at any price is really going to be down to how you play and where you play and even with which starting position you play. I don't tick any of those boxes so this isn't something I'd in good conscience say 'go out and buy', but I'd also recommend doing the digging to see whether it's something which interests you and how you play CK3.", "timestamp_created": 1644376391, "timestamp_updated": 1644487362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109827242": {"recommendationid": "109827242", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273529066", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "schinese", "review": "\u5410", "timestamp_created": 1644376386, "timestamp_updated": 1644376386, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109827190": {"recommendationid": "109827190", "author": {"steamid": "76561197969687669", "num_games_owned": 561, "num_reviews": 57, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "It pains me to give Royal Court a negative review, because I was so excited and hopeful for this DLC.  I couldn't get into Crusader Kings 1 or 2, but CK3 is what finally got me, and I have really loved the game.  I figured upcoming DLC would be up to the same high standards (I liked the Norse flavor pack).\n\nBut no.  Royal Court is neither worth the price nor worth the extra long wait.  I'm not even sure why it took so long.  Artifacts are completely underwhelming -- sink some money so you can get a sword that gives you +1 prowess, and then pay for an Antiquarian to slow down its decay, but you eventually need to repair the sword anyways.  I eventually got the Ark of the Covenant and still didn't care.  I stopped trying to get artifacts completely; they just weren't worth the cost and hassle.\n\nCustoms are nice, and I'm sure a lot of time was spent on customs, but they just feel like Religion part 2.  I mean, customs give you more rules to live by.  Which is fine and helpful, but nothing mind-blowing.\n\nI was feeling a bit burnt out on CK3, but was so excited for Royal Court to add a fresh element.  But everything added is just kind of blah.

The entire world's been dealing with COVID for almost two years now, guys. I get that it takes time to adjust to at-home workflow, but this is a frankly appalling level of productivity. Is it because of the 3D court? Did someone have to learn how to model 3D interiors from scratch in the Clausewitz engine? Because, I'm gonna level with you, it wasn't worth it. \n\nIf this DLC was $20 or less, it'd be an... acceptable deal. The features it adds are incredible for modding, and future official updates.

Lo m\u00e1s importante son los nuevos trabajos en la corte, que permite emplear a m\u00e1s cortesanos y mantenerlos contentos, pero eso tambi\u00e9n es parte del parche gratuito.\n\n-Inspiraciones: interesante pero no mucho m\u00e1s, especialmente considerando que la parte importante (artefactos e inventario) son parte del parche gratuito.\n\n-Reformar-Divergir Cultura y Culturas H\u00edbridas: probablemente lo m\u00e1s interesante que agregue al juego base, aunque lo m\u00e1s importante (\u00e9tica, pilares y tradiciones) son parte del parche gratuito. Personalmente, lo veo como una complejidad extra en un aspecto que no hac\u00eda falta ahora, ignorando elementos que est\u00e1n mucho m\u00e1s necesitados de mejoras como el combate, relaci\u00f3n con los vasallos e incluso la religi\u00f3n (especialmente catolicismo y islam).\n\n-CONCLUSI\u00d3N: un buen parche gratuito con buenas adiciones, pero un terrible primer DLC (que es lo que estoy rese\u00f1ando) en el que se perdi\u00f3 el tiempo de desarrollo (no olvidar que se posterg\u00f3 varios meses) en crear un escenario 3D que no me parece necesario (ni creo que el resultado final haya sido muy bueno incluso con la configuraci\u00f3n gr\u00e1fica al m\u00e1ximo) y peque\u00f1as opciones extra sobre lo que se agrega gratuitamente que dif\u00edcilmente justifica el precio de este contenido. Yo lo recib\u00ed como parte de la Royal Edition (pagado hace 1 a\u00f1o y medio), pero de haberlo tenido que adquirir de forma separada me hubiese parecido una gran decepci\u00f3n, por lo que recomiendo a quien este interesado en adquirirlo, esperar a una buena oferta ya que para nada lo considero imperativo (especialmente viendo todo lo que agrega el parche 1.5 de forma gratuita).",

The game, I can now say after playing for a few hours, feels far more complete. It feels whole, and for that reason I could not recommend it more.

The realm is of course very important, but the people inside the realm has always interested me more, and it seems like the game has focused on that.\n\nFor example, while holding court, I welcomed a rather incompetent man to serve as a knight to me. By the time that ruler died, the Knight was middle aged but actually rather talented, he learned blademaster trait. And then I heard him whispering to my wife a love poem and so of course I banished him from the realm.

And this is coming from someone who enjoys roleplaying campaigns.\n- The Royal Court is just a massive money drain with little benefit. Is -12 gold per month worth a 1+ prestige, slightly better stress and hiring cheaper guests? Also really, we can't customize our court at all beside hanging up some artifacts?\n- Diverging/Hybridizing cultures is so unfulfilling right now. Beyond some minor stat boosts, you're hardly changing up your experience at all.\n- Artifacts are just mediocre stat boosts that will just bloat your inventory slowly degrading into nothing. Beyond a few mythical artifacts like the ark of the covenant, there is nothing here that really stands out. CK2 had a handgun, glasses, necronomicon, mjolnir, plate armor and so many other unique artifacts. I get that CK3 is trying to be a little more... 'realistic' but right now artifacts are just boring and mediocre ones far too frequent. I preferred when Crusader Kings had a supernatural aspect.\n- One thing I did like about this DLC was holding court and having vassals petition you on various issues that require your involvement. I for once in a long time actually felt invested in others beyond my direct family. Also you can actually play passive without being bored out of your mind... Or atleast until all the new events become redundant.\nEDIT: It's already become redundant... Seeing the same several court petitions over and over again.\n\nFree Update - 8/10 Great additions this game really needed.\nPaid DLC - 6/10 Underwhelming content that definitely isn't worth $30.\n\nGet it on sale for -50% off because that's what it's worth.

En caso de un gobernante feudal es un poco m\u00e1s accesible. \nPara cerrar los cambios en la cultura est\u00e1 la inclusi\u00f3n de los idiomas, los cuales est\u00e1n completamente desaprovechados, ya que solo sirven para ganar una peque\u00f1a opini\u00f3n positiva de personajes que hablan la lengua que aprendes. \nEn cuanto a la corte y los nuevos puestos menores, es lo peor de este DLC. Las cortes solo est\u00e1n desbloqueadas para reyes y emperadores de gobierno de clan o feudal, las arquitecturas de las cortes son pocas, la personalizaci\u00f3n que le podes hacer a la corte es muy superficial, el prestigio de la corte no est\u00e1 bien planteado, etc. \nLos puestos menores de la corte son algo interesante, pero muy desaprovechado. Primero, no entiendo que elementos hacen que un personaje sea mejor opci\u00f3n para un determinado puesto. Es algo que ya me pasaba con el m\u00e9dico de la corte, hab\u00eda veces donde buscaba a un m\u00e9dico y las opciones que me presentaban ninguna ten\u00eda el rasgo de m\u00e9dico, pero para el juego hab\u00eda uno que era mejor para el puesto que otro. Con este DLC es lo mismo, pero en vez de ser un puesto son m\u00e1s de una docena. Y Segundo, muchos de los puestos son in\u00fatiles; especialmente los puestos reales, donde la mayor\u00eda solo da prestigio para tu corte, por lo que si son un rey con gobierno de clan son puestos in\u00fatiles.\nEn cuanto a los artefactos, est\u00e1n bien.  \nEn definitiva, creo que el DLC tiene ideas interesantes, pero las plantea mal, como las cortes y los idiomas, o los platea bien pero podr\u00edan ser mejorados, como los puestos menores de las cortes y las culturas. Tambi\u00e9n me parece que para lo que termina ofreciendo es muy caro, m\u00e1s si consideramos los bugs y errores de traducci\u00f3n en el caso espec\u00edfico de la traducci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola. \n\n", "timestamp_created": 1644359632, "timestamp_updated": 1645312020, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109815489": {"recommendationid": "109815489", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990845964", "num_games_owned": 408, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "Not worth 30\u20ac", "timestamp_created": 1644359342, "timestamp_updated": 1644359342, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505473017692565918", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109815471": {"recommendationid": "109815471", "author": {"steamid": "76561198249118870", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "brazilian", "review": "Melhor dlc, valeu apena o pre\u00e7o", "timestamp_created": 1644359326, "timestamp_updated": 1644359326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109815434": {"recommendationid": "109815434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005783119", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "So after almost a year without content we finally got this ripoff of a dlc. \n30\u20ac for basically a few small additions and some mechanic reworks.

The inventory system is fantastic and establishes a strong framework for modding and future DLC whilst the court system is full of potential for rewarding (and punishing) your courtiers. Cultural divergence is game changing for those who want more empire customisation. \n\nYou'll see complaints about the 3D throne room but this is a fraction of the new content they added and probably the least impactful of the changes.

On one hand, I really like the hybrid culture system that came with this update and the new customizable coat of arms. But at its core, this is supposed to be about the royal court, so is it a success in that regard?\n\nI'd probably say, uh, not so much... My main problem with it is that the court feels extremely lifeless. You're essentially looking at a still shot from different angles, in which case I really wonder why have an environment of this type at all when you could do some an easier and more stylistic representation (that already exists in the game as events!). Is it cool that you can display artifacts in your court? Yes, it is cool, but unless you're actively going into the court to look at it or for the limited-time events, there's not much reason for you to be there. And I have a feeling it's going to wear off and become irritating busywork extremely fast.\n\nThe worst part about it is that it's not actually more dynamic than the normal event system. The NPCs aren't moving and you don't even see thing from the perspective of the ruler. Instead of feeling like a visual novel, it feels like playing an isometric game. Again, it's worse than the original solution they came up with which has existed in the game since launch.\n\nUltimately, was an ambitious idea; but I'm not sure it's one that merited this much work when so many other areas of the game are either broken or desperately lacking. If you asked me to make a wishlist about what I wanted to see added to vanilla CK3, this court room display wouldn't even be on the list.

Let's take one example:\n\n*Cultural Acceptance*\n\nThis is the new companion to County Control. If you have low cultural acceptance in your counties, it counts against you and you have to manage it exactly like County Control. There's absolutely nothing fun about it. Nothing new. It's actually a copy/paste mechanic that just exists to give you something new to manage. \n\nThe same mindset bleeds over into the actual Royal Court. You can petition a liege once every 5 years (no cooldown or grace period if said liege dies - just once every 5 years and that's it). Your liege can reject or accept your petition with a consequence pop-up. \n\nI petitioned my liege to tour my capital county. Even though I was her Spymaster and she liked me, she refused. But then I received this message as the consequence:\n\n\"You lose 15 opinion of you.\" \n\nThanks.\n\nThe new inventory mechanic is interesting on paper but there's some weirdness involved. Like your Emperor may wear a resplendent suit of armor and then when he dies, he passes it to his 1 year old son and his son is wearing it. Magical shrinking baby armor which the kid can't use anyway.\n\nThere are new interaction options for Sparring and Learning Languages. \n\nLanguages are important because if you petition your liege and don't understand their language, you will sound stupid and they'll laugh at you. \n\nThis makes some sense but once again, it just adds more meaningless button presses to make sure you're literally speaking the same language as your liege before petitioning them. And learning languages just takes up valuable time and resources, meaning you have to put off other things to learn the language to petition your liege who may reject you anyway and then for some reason you'll lose opinion of yourself?\n\nThe 3D throne room is ok. It's just ok. It does the job. It lets you see everyone's little gaggle of close friends and it has neat pedestals for artifacts. But honestly there are so many damn artifacts in the game that you'll get dizzy trying to keep them all straight. And they don't seem to matter a whole heck of a lot other than as eye candy because with a game that spans hundreds of years, you can't have a truly overpowered relic or it would just break the game. So they're just kind of neat.\n\nAlso, you can't utilize a throne room unless you're a King or Emperor or head of a clan. So if you were excited to maybe have your own palace or keep as a Duke or Count, it's not happening. You can still recruit the new flavor of courtiers but you don't get your own room to dress up and enjoy.\n\nSmall issues remain unfixed from the base game, like babies doing weird adult stuff all the time. I had an infant son get poisoned because he helped me wrap a poisoned package to kill the King. Then the King's infant son wore his dad's armor. Then when I killed that son, the infant Queen invited me to become Spymaster - so it was extra easy to kill her.\n\nIt's a decent add-on but it's just ok and it's worth $10, not $30.

The positive reviews are a paid hack, a bunch of actual children, and some losers who like reddit memes that have been retold ad infinitum ever since ck2 released. I cannot imagine anyone who likes this game as anything but a loser, go find a better game or hobby.\nIt has also just occurred to me that one of the main premises of this dlc is nonsense as well. Medieval courts, until like the 1700s, used Latin as the courtly language. Kings and politicians didn't speak like commoners in official business. In fact, there's more Latin texts about the kingdoms of the time period than texts in their native languages.

Whats the point of this DLC? The 3D court doesnt even look good and the lighting is off\nThe free update adds more to the game than this. For some reason the game considers Albanians to be Greeks? They made Central Dalmatia Serbian (Werent present in Dalmatia till the Ottoman conquests pushed them towards the north and west) and Bosnian (as a nation Bosniaks didnt exist till the 20th century) and for some reason also added Greeks (Byzantine citizens =/= Greeks, Greeks were never present in Medieval Croatia. The roman remnants lived in a few coastal cities and on the islands, and still were a minority compared to the Slavs). They also decided to make \"Serbo-Croatian\" a thing now in the game, also a 20th century creation. Whats next? The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany as formable Empires if you already are going towards including 20th century politics in a medieval simulator? Bollocks\nIm glad that they added the Carantanians, who indeed were seen as a separate people in the middle ages and who, while being a small nation, did have their influence on Europe. But they do not speak \"Serbo-Croatian\". The 19th century language reforms didnt happen, rename it to \"Old Church Slavonic\" or something like \"Old Slavonic\", this is an insult to our intelligence. Primo\u017e Trubar and Matthias Flacius are rotating in their graves\n\nHistorical Immersion was never the goal of the dev team it seems. Most of the features from Ck2 are missing (like all of the bookmarks, playable republics, nomads etc.) Ck3 focuses heavily on the court but then again only has a small fraction of the events present in the previous game. Roleplaying is supposed to be the main part of the game, but I guess paradox didnt realise that its supposed to be \"historical roleplay\" and not just a LE reddit seduction backstab infanticide simulator set in a bland medieval timeframe\n\nIts cringe to say that Imperator Romes map and UI are better than Ck3s, but its true. They try to make the game as pretty as possible but the models look like plastic dolls, the poses are all unatural and the skin and hair are shiny. Like a Second Life server with slightly better models. The second DLC for Ck3, the first one was absolute garbage and this one is just underwhelming looking at what modders make for FREE.\n\nIs it so bad that its unplayable? No. Does it need improvement?

The changes to culture are fun and and depth to that aspect of the game, but it is a feature that could have easily been in from the start considering it is similar to the way religion customization functions. And then the may draw of this expansion, the Royal Court, is lackluster to say the least. Firstly, the fact that the are just a handful of preset courts seems a bit lazy for the price tag. Every court in the Mediterranean looks the same, every court in Northern Europe looks the same, etc. On top of that all the artifacts that you can acquire look relatively similar regardless of what tier they are. The artifact feature would have been made much better if there was more player customization in terms of what crafted artifacts look like and what kind of benefits you would like them to provide you with. Court events also seem a bit hollow, after a certain point I seem to just receive the same events on repeat with little variation. This is disappointing considering how engaging the events in Crusader Kings II were. All in all, I am still having fun with the dlc, but the amount of content does not justify the $30 price tag. I think it is only really worth it for those of us who received it at a massive discount by having the royal edition of CK III. I hope that future dlcs will get back to the core of the game and improve upon things such as the Crusades and managing your lands in meaningful ways like what was done with dlcs such as Holy Fury and

Ihrer Kultur.\n- Du hast au\u00dferdem die M\u00f6glichkeit, den Thronsaal noch zu gestalten bzw. auszuschm\u00fccken. Dazu geh\u00f6ren auch Artefakte, die dir Boni verleihen.\n- Auch f\u00fcr das Gameplay spielt der Thronsaal eine Rolle, da du dort Bittsteller aus dem Volk empfangen kannst und neue Zufallsereignisse ausgel\u00f6st werden.\n- Ebenfalls neu ist die HofPracht: \u00dcber Faktoren wie die Personen am Hof, Mode, Unterbringung und Verpflegung kannst du in der Prachtstufe aufsteigen,\nwas Gold kostet, im Gegenzug aber Ruhm bzw. Prestige bringt und weitere n\u00fctzliche Vorteile.\n- Dazu kommen Hof\u00e4mter ins Spiel, darunter Titel wie Vorkoster, Stallmeister und Hoftutor.\n- Charaktere sind nun au\u00dferdem in der Lage, Sprachen zu lernen, da das neue Kultursystem auch sprachliche Faktoren hinzugef\u00fcgt hat und\nam Hofe eine Amtssprache f\u00fcr das Reich gilt.\n\n- Ebenfalls wichtig ist das neue dynamische Kultursystem. Dabei basiert jede Kultur (wie zuvor schon die Religion) auf drei S\u00e4ulen, was eine genauere Ausgestaltung der kulturellen Identit\u00e4t erlaubt. Auf\ndiese Weise sind selbst Mischkulturen m\u00f6glich. Viele Boni und Vorteile k\u00f6nnen durch das Erweitern der Traditionen einer Kultur erhalten werden, welches jedoch Prestige und Zeit kostet.\n\n- Dar\u00fcber hinaus gibt es ein umfangreiches Inventar und Gegenstandsystem. Wir k\u00f6nnen wertvolle Artefakte, R\u00fcstungen, Waffen, M\u00f6bel oder Banner in Auftrag geben. Je nach Ereignissen und\nEntscheidungen kann die Wertigkeit und die positiven Eigenschaften variieren.\n\nMein Pers\u00f6nliches Highlight ist im Ruler-Editor enthalten. Wir k\u00f6nnen nun endlich unser eigenes Banner/ Wappen der Dynastie umfangreich anpassen und gestalten.\nMehrere Farben, Muster und Varianten sind nun m\u00f6glich ohne durch ausw\u00fcrfeln auf ein sch\u00f6nes Wappen hoffen zu m\u00fcssen. Es sind kaum grenzen gesetzt.\n\n[b]Eigene Meinung[/b]\n\nOb sich f\u00fcr euch die derzeit 30\u20ac (Stand: 08.02.22) lohnen, k\u00f6nnt Ihr durch die Videos f\u00fcr euch selbst entscheiden.\nIch selbst w\u00fcrde die Erweiterung erst um die 15\u20ac-20\u20ac erwerben, da viele der neuen Features auch im kostenlosen Patch enthalten sind. Das relevanteste Kernfeature mit dem Thronsaal, den Gegenst\u00e4nden und den neuen Zufallsereignissen wird erst durch das DLC Royal Court freigeschaltet.", "timestamp_created": 1644342261, "timestamp_updated": 1644406879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "109799337": {"recommendationid": "109799337", "author": {"steamid": "76561198829929551", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The DLC is good, 3D spaces and characters make a huge difference in a game like this and you know this if you played the game for more than a couple of hours. \nTaking the series to 3D as much as possible and as quickly as possible should be the logical next step in an already deep role playing game such as this.
