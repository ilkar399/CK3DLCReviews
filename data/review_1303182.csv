Sad to see my favorite game series to devolve into a cheap mobile port, toned for the casual gamer, instead of the hardcore strategy fans that made ck2 what it became in its apex. 

What the future of the game series seems to be is more mana based economy rather than the meaningful interaction that previous paradox titles offered the new UI is at best clumsy, this applies to this DLC also. The Court mechanics are hidden behind multitute of menus and offer very little for its price. The new cultural mechanics could be intresting but since they as well are at best shallow, like the confusing tiered combat system only add to the confusion. 

For those loved Ck2 or hardcore strategy, I recommend giving this a miss or at least more time to mature. Right now Ck3 is very shallow in every aspect.

"38","111758248","111758248","english","See quite a few people hating on Royal Court and as someone who has played a bit of ck3 thought I would give my opinion. The DLC has its flaws, and, I agree, is slightly overpriced. However, I still think for a ck3 fan this DLC is definitely worth it.

Pros: Let's start with the good side of this DLC, which is pretty attractive in my opinion. Firstly, we have the royal court itself. It costs a hella lot of money late game, but I think it's a very good addition to the game: court grandeur seems like a necessary step for getting a leg-up on rival empires late game via getting some decent passive buffs and provides a gold sink for when you're making a bit more than you really need; court positions are interesting and fairly dynamic with some decent buffs (but are a bit too expensive early game); hold court is a feature lots of people dislike due to its staleness but in my opinion adds a few good opportunities for RP and different vassal interactions, and as an extension pay homage and petition liege make playing as a vassal (personally my favourite starting condition) a bit more flavourful; finally, the courtroom itself is pretty cool and provides many opportunities for RP and some passive buffs. Artefacts are less exciting than I would have hoped but, again, provide some alright passive buffs and RP flavour. 
There's also the other main attraction in cultures which I think is an exceedingly good revamp. Cultures feel a lot more dynamic and it forces you to consider cultures more carefully and be more careful of extending your realm into other cultures for reasons other than independence revolts. I think the diverging and hybrid cultures are pretty neat too and, again, give amazing RP opportunities.
Overall, as someone who likes a bit of RP to spice up a run, I think Royal Court excels in making the game much more flavourful, interesting, and dynamic. 

Cons: At the end of the day, the features are much less fleshed out than I would like them to be. The court itself feels a bit barebones when you've played for a while and tbh gets more annoying late game when you have other things to worry about than whoever your court seneschal is. Also, the claim artefact system is extremely annoying in how you often get bombarded with demands for some artefact you forgot that you even had, artefacts too are less interesting than I would have hoped. One more issue that I have is that, due to the new court system and grandeur, kingdoms and empires make much more beneficial alliances than before, which makes sense, but also sabotages the early game because kingdoms and empires at war (England and Byzantium in 1066 to be specific) instantly get incredible alliances and defeat everyone; this especially means that Harold Godwinson wins in every 1066 start, which is cool and all, but gets pretty stale.

Overall: 7/10. Has its flaws for sure and needs a few tweaks but adds a lot of cool new features and is great for those who enjoy RP. Also brings a lot of potential to the modding scene (looking at you AGOT) which is always exciting since the game facilitates modding and has a very good community.",1646677805,1646677805,TRUE,2,0,"0.532163739204406738",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198237974028",69,6,0,0,NA,0

"49","111686015","111686015","english","The whole point of the DLC, the royal court itself, is the weakest part of the DLC by far. In addition to just not being very interactive in general, it actively hurts the other actual good parts of the update, like artifacts, by making them intrinsically tied to your courtroom. Court events seem to repeat frequently (I've had a cult trying to find a lost head that's rolled into my castle multiple times on the same ruler) and it's gotten to the point that I'm not even bothering to hold court because the events are too repetitive. These events also seem to exist in an alternative universe - you will have humble, content vassals demanding that you give them something because someone else recently got something similar and now they're jealous, even though the rest of the game is great about keeping internal consistency for these kinds of things. Not only that, but there's just an utter lack of things that use the courtroom anyhow. Weddings, coronations, and other party-like events seem like they would be right at home in the court and might actually give a reason for such a thing to exist. Nope, those are all still tucked away invisibly, only seen through the occasional event.

Furthermore, Paradox justified the price and delays by the fact that they had to have their team learn how to use 3D modeling tools to make the court. Beyond the fact that this is a stupid take (as a consumer, I don't care about time spent, I care about the value I get out of a product), it also seems like an overall wasted effort. You only ever look at the court when there is an event or you're putting in new artifacts. Your court is supposed to dynamically adjust who's in it based on the state your realm is in. Except, again, you never look in your court unless there is a specific reason. Even during holding court, when people take different positions to supposedly help build ""immersion"" within the event, it doesn't even feel worth it - the text alone does a far better job at allowing me to imagine the scenario in my head. I'm not sure why they felt the need to move away with ck3's basic event system where it simply shows you all characters involved with some expression on their face, as that system both gave you a quick look at who is involved in the event and just enough visualization to go along with the text without trying to do too much. In comparison, I barely know who's involved in court events because the camera is almost always hiding the faces of the actual people that are important to the event, instead showing only their backs. Once again, the major social events that actually would benefit from the court view don't take place there, despite the fact that the royal court trailer uses a wedding as an example of the purpose of the court.

On the other hand, Hybrid Cultures, Cultural Divergence, inspirations, and even the court grandeur mechanics are all pretty great additions. Hybridization and divergence finally allow for dynamic cultural outcomes from either owning large swathes of different cultural territory. Inspirations are alright, although it'd be nice if I, the ruler, could actually make something by myself, like writing my own book rather than making someone else do it for me. Finally, while the 3D royal court is extremely underwhelming for me, I do actually like the mechanical system behind it, wherein you can essentially bribe people to come live with you in return for nice things and how your court and by extension, courtiers, reflect your cultural ethos, with warlike cultures and courts naturally producing more military minded individuals.  That being said, Paradox made it clear the majority of their time and focus was on making the 3D court, which just doesn't bring very much value to the game, and in some cases, actively lowers the value of other things.

In conclusion, there's some really fun ideas that I'm sure modders will make good use of but even the good ideas can't hide the fact that the vast majority of the $30 this DLC costs is tied to a rather useless and underwhelming 3D court. In fact, while it seems like the other mechanics are well-integrated into the base game (such as grandeur affecting feasts and hunts), the courtroom itself seems to exist on its island.",1646582405,1646582405,FALSE,6,0,"0.545454561710357666",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198048005276",811,7,0,0,NA,0

The actual court adds some much-needed personality and roleplay value to the game. It is especially fun when playing as a small realm, which makes it all the more frustrating that the court is for some reason not available to duke or count-tier rulers. Artifacts are fine, though the various interesting ways to obtain them are especially fun. The best feature of the DLC is the ability to hybridize and diverge cultures, making them much less static and allowing you to adapt your character and realm's culture to your playstyle. This is unfortunately also plagued by characteristically absurd design choices by Paradox, such as hybridization being much easier to do than diverging despite generally conferring far more advantages, and each culture having a static 'ethos' that essentializes them into a specific specialization (nothing dubious at all about the fact that most Arab and Indian cultures are 'spiritual'). 
The pack also includes some nice new music tracks and a very few assets.
So while it's a good DLC, it's not nearly worth the full price (I got it automatically with Royal Edition), since it has less substance than some of the much cheaper CK2 expansions. It also makes you wonder what the development team has been doing for the past year.

Die grundlegende Idee, durch ausrüstbare Gegenstände und die Hofpolitik mehr Tiefe in das Spiel zu bringen, ist sehr löblich. An der Umsetzung muss jedoch noch gefeilt werden. Items bekommt man zu viel und zu leicht. Ich bin als Graf im Jahre 888 gestartet und nach nicht einmal der hälfte der Spielzeit habe ich legendäre Items, die bei mir im Lager versauern, weil ich keinen Platz mehr habe, sie auszustellen. Die höfische Politik ist am Anfang zwar ganz nett, die Events werden aber schnell redundant. Es gibt einfach zu wenige von ihnen und irgendwann klickt man sich nur noch durch, ohne den Text zu lesen. Auch schade ist, dass man durch Hofämter und Items nicht mehr machen kann, als stupide Boni zu addieren. Schön wäre es, wenn Items oder der Königshof Einfluss auf die Politik hätten. Dafür müsste jedoch erst das relativ eindimensionale Diplomatiesystem überarbeitet werden... Vielleicht ja, beim nächsten DLC. Royal Court benötigt in jedem Fall noch Updates, doch dafür allein würde ich mir nicht die Mühe machen, eine Rezension zu schreiben. Das größte Problem mit diesem DLC ist der unverschämte Preis von 29.99. Selbst wenn die vorgeschlagenen Verbesserungen vorgenommen werden würden, wäre dieses DLC nicht dieses Geld wert.

Paradox, I am begging you, let a handful of people actually test your DLCs before releasing them and you can catch this stuff before releasing broken updates.

"75","111454897","111454897","english","Should Royal Court be part of the game? Yes. Should it be a DLC? No. 

Compared to the DLCs of CK2, Royal Court is closer to a flavour pack. It only affects king+ tier rulers and even excludes tribal lords, making Northern and African rulers less desirable to play as. 

The royal court is supposedly intended to make the characters seem more alive through additional interactions with them. Conversely, I find the opposite effect to be the case. Much like the ""romance scheme"", the characters seem to act or wish for something that is very out of character when it comes to their traits. Such as when I held court and my wife-friend-soulmate came stomping up to my throne in front of my whole court demanding that I grant her the county I had just granted my uncle. An insignificant county of which she had previously had no known relation to, in a duchy of which I was the holder of several other counties I could have granted her instead. Challenging my uncle and steward who had better traits and stats that made him a more competent holder than her, and demanding that I performed an action that would otherwise be considered as tyrannical. It seemed so misplaced and as if the conflict was created just to force a difficult decision, for which there was no good solution, because either one or the other would hate me, or they would dual and either of them would die. As with most of the court decisions that are forced upon the player, they seem misplaced and ruin immersion, and are almost never have a beneficial outcome, meaning, holding court is not something you as a player would like to do and so it does not make gameplay more enjoyable, but on the contrary, it takes away from it. The other court features are interesting enough, but quite minor. 

In conclusion, I think the Royal Court should be part of the game with some tweaking, but I do not think that the content it adds justifies calling it a DLC level expansion and certainly not the price tag. Most of reviews of players I've read that are positive to this ""DLC"" state that they had already payed for the first expansion, and so they do not care about the value for money. It makes it even worse that this was delayed 8 months, meaning we should probably have seen the second DLC by now if the developers had stayed on schedule. Yes, yes, delays come with excuses, but that is the truth of it. CK3 was released 1.5 years ago and it still feels like half the game CK2 was. The Royal Court feels like it was hyped because the developers made an addition in 3D when they are used to making things in 2D. It's a flashy feature that grows boring after 2 hours of gameplay, because it has no substance and does not feel beneficial to gameplay.",1646323791,1646323791,FALSE,53,1,"0.773263335227966309",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198065791718",12,2,0,0,NA,0
"76","111452886","111452886","english","I think Paradox kind of painted themselves into a corner with this DLC, and also were the victims of bad luck.

Crusader Kings II wasn't the most feature-complete game at launch, but every major expansion expanded the world and gameplay in ways that felt monumental - Sword of Islam, the Old Gods, and Rajas of India (not my favourite DLC but it did add a lot of content) hugely changed the game, and some of the more iterative packs like Legacy of Rome, Way of Life, and Conclave fleshed out the game in meaningful ways (I also want to mention The Republic which was low-key one of my favourite add-ons to the game). CK3 launched as a much more feature-complete game with two start-dates and an even bigger map than CK2 had, and even though some parts of the map are under-cooked everything was still playable except for republics (boo) and theocracies.

So here's CK3's first substantial expansion, more than a year after the launch of the base game, after multiple delays which wasn't really Paradox's fault. It is offering a totally re-hauled culture system and tons of interactions for king/emperor-tier characters and their courtiers. And the result is...fine. It's a good add-on that does add depth and decisions, but I can't help but feel underwhelmed. The court features add a nice bit of extra gameplay to your mid-late game and seeing hybrid cultures develop is fun, but for how long this pack was in development, and especially for the price, the end product just falls a bit flat.

If you're an obsessive CK/Paradox player like me, you will buy this price be damned and you'll enjoy the features it adds because they're mostly good, and that's why I ultimately chose the thumbs-up icon for this review.

New version and the 3D courtroom, although pleasant, feels insulting to paying customers. Optimization diminished for some reason and now the game is way more demanding in terms of hardware than it used to be. 
Long review:
I pre-purchased this DLC along with the other stuff bundled up in the Royal Edition. I Wouldn't have spent a dime on it if I had not pre-purchased it. Everything I've enjoyed about this DLC is included in the free update. That is cultures specifically, artifacts less so but are still a welcome feature. Court positions are… okay? They’re hardly noticeable as far as gameplay goes. In essence these are three stat modifiers, the Culture aspect being the most intricate, but all in all pretty shallow and unnoticeable, even downright forgettable. 
All of this is rightful content for a very juicy flavor pack, or a very generous free update. This means you are paying Specifically for the 3D room of the court. And in all honesty, it’s rather underwhelming. Like I said, the least enjoyable part of this entire DLC is what you’re actually paying for. Events related to holding court repeat themselves painfully often, the courtroom interaction with other characters is non-existent, and you can´t even roam freely in the room. Players pretty much need to wait for a popup to appear indicating there’s some randomized event in the courtroom, like an optional life event you can even bypass if you don’t notice the notification or just don’t care about it. Which, considering this is supposed to be the main attraction of this whole ordeal, is a huge miss in terms of execution and design of an overall neat but ultimately unnecessary addition to the game.  Actual improvements to the game were released in the free update. And while very generous from Paradox, it feels very insulting to the paying customers. That’s why I would advise you to save your money and enjoy the free update, which is ironically the best part of this DLC. 
On a side note, the game feels rather unoptimized. I run a rather beefy gaming laptop and I swear I had never experienced such high system demands. I don’t know if this is exclusive to the 3D aspect of the court or the entire new version overall. But all in all, it feels as if a lot in terms of performance and system optimization was forfeited in the name of a feature that hardly adds anything to the overall gameplay experience. 
Paradox needed a DLC that deepened Ck3, that amplified roleplay and immersion possibilities and brought both Ck2 players craving a more in-depth experience and new players used to a 3D environment and gameplay alike. Instead, they released… this.

"98","111220129","111220129","english","It's a little bit sad seeing this DLC getting so many negative reviews, and I feel like Paradox do themselves disservice by naming this Royal Court, and I think most people give it negative review because of that. This DLC focus is more aimed towards the cultural stuff, with the court and artifacts being the big ""luxury"" feature. But I suppose the marketing team thinks it'd be more fascinating for players if it's titled as such.

Royal Court DLC allows you to play around with your dynasty culture. It tries to mimic the historical cultural divergence, like how whole Holy Roman Empire diverged into multiple kingdoms that each possess their own unique cultures as time goes by. Gameplay wise, it allows you, as an influential leader of your people, to steer your people towards a specific culture and lifestyle that you prefer (if you roleplay), or to benefit (if you prefer to minmax).

Culture and language also plays important part in your expansion. Having vassals that can't communicate properly with you and having different way of life is, of course, not ideal. You will find rapid expansions to be tad more dangerous, and might spell huge problem especially when it's time to pass the crown to your child. In general, you will find that large empires will have a lot of vassals with negative relations with you, and that's where the ""Royal Court"" mechanic comes into play. Having high court grandeur will net you positive relation to pretty much everyone, and this helps offset the negative relations you have with rulers of different cultures. 

Or you can just ignore everything I said and basically exploit the heck out of these new features and just conquer everything. Yes, you can do that, but really you always been able to do that without this DLC anyway. 

Of course, having artifacts to display and seeing a 3d court with people doing stuffs is a plus, but I do wish they are animated. They just freeze doing very simple animations (like whispering to your character) and the such, and I can tell that they have rather limited budget and time on this, as you can only access the court mechanic when you are at king/queen and emperor/empress level.

Overall I think this DLC is a good offer, and frankly I'm tad confused that some players think the CK 2 DLCs are more worth it. Like come on, while the court mechanic is rather basic, this is basically the very first time Paradox ever dabble in having something 3d and decent looking that are not just live wallpapers. The culture mechanic is fascinating and gives you the options to either play tall and focus as a small but super buff monoculture empire, or go for massive multiculture empire with all the caveats.",1646030996,1646030996,TRUE,1,0,"0.461561024188995361",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198068989172",327,8,0,0,NA,0

With that said, however, I do feel that this expansion IS worth owning and playing.  The two most common arguments I've seen among the negative reviews I've read are the price and general underwhelming scope of the DLC.  Royal Court may not be a great value for your money, and it may not be the DLC some people wanted it to be, but personally I love the added content.

To assist you with deciding if this DLC is right for you, at any price, I've put together a little Q & A session specifically calibrated for content from Paradox Interactive.  They have a reputation.  

Q 1:  Does this DLC break the game or make it impossible to play?
   A:  No. 

Q 2:  Does the accompanying version update make playing without the DLC almost or completely impossible?
A:  No. 

Q 3:  Can I live without this DLC?
A:  Yes.

Q 4:  Will this DLC change the way I play the game?
A:  Potentially.  You have to be at least a feudal kingdom in order to utilize the actual court aspect of the DLC but you can still acquire relics you can equip at any rank.  The relics themselves can have a very wide range of useful bonuses attached to them, from increasing your vassal limit to boosting your fertility rate, to boosting your combat abilities.  You could both treat all this as just background flavor, or make the acquisition of the best relics one of the main focuses of your campaign.  

Q 5:  Will this DLC warrant me starting up another new campaign?
A:  Maybe.  Again, the relics aspect can add a lot to your game, but largely everything is just about adding flavor to your campaign.  While the potential is there for an NPC to use a relic you possess that they have a claim to as justification for war (or vice versa), nearly every other aspect of the game is unchanged.  However, the changes to culture that came with the free version update are awesome and, in my opinion, warrant a new campaign on their own.

Final thoughts:  If you already love the base game, crave some additional flavor in your campaign, and don't mind spending the money, you'll probably love Royal Court.  But it's not going to be for everyone.  The relics do make for an awesome addition to the game but if they don't appeal to you in the slightest then you can ignore this DLC entirely.",1645954321,1645954321,TRUE,32,0,"0.75732344388961792",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198030722331",112,6,0,0,NA,0

I do not understand why the developers took so much time for just the 3D throne room (hyped it up when it's really bare in game and really serves barely any purpose except to hold court/inspirations - aka artifacts). I feel like the game pack we got with north culture (expanding on it - Varangian adventures, etc.) gave us more than this ""expansion"" pack (supposed to be more content than the first released DLC we got). Most of this feels like it should have been in the base game or added in a cheaper game pack/updates not an expansion worth this much.

Edit: Also idk if this is for anyone else, when I loaded up past saves before this DLC released people in the save game were ""near-dying"" (almost everyone in my dynasty died) and every time I clicked the innovations tab under culture my game crashed.

"116","111044247","111044247","english","Alright so i just played a full campaign with this new DLC. It took 125 hours from earliest start date to end date so I have some feedback to give. Im going to give this a hesitant thumbs up. I think there is a decent bit here that I enjoyed that helps round out the game, but it has many flaws and some odd choices in game design, not to mention many, many bugs still in the game.

Im glad they tried something different by adding the court system. It transitions into a new screen where you can visually see your court and change out artifacts and stuff, but to be honest, it sucks that you cant design your court more how you want to. Its cool that you can see artifacts, but why cant you full design your court if that is the point of the system. I suspect multiplayer capabilities would make this difficult so it was rounded down to a more basic function of a very limited amount of designs which is unfortunate.

Lets get into some pros and cons from my perspective

-Having equipable items is cool. Yes i understand that this isnt specifically apart of this DLC but it kinda goes with everything because of inspired people.
-The court itself is cool idea. -side note I had an idea for a new DLC that would be basically jousting tournaments or even gladiator games at the colosseum. With jousting tournaments having different events and based on where its held, weather, terrain, and time of year, or being at war could play different aspects of the tournament. The colosseum could have different types of fights and different creatures like lions, elephants, ect to change up, but this is just an idea i had.
-Holding court time of every 5 years is fine to me, if i was able to do it more it would be annoying.
-hybrid cultures and cultural divergence are great improvements to the game, that let you change what you want to do and if you want to also roleplay, more options for you.

Cons
-Im hesitant to say price, because I played for 125 hours and enjoyed myself, so to get it out of the way, I dont think the price is too high. BUT, for a new player who wont pick it up again because of this DLC, I think it is an issue.
-Grandeur is a missed opportunity. Yes it provides buffs and stuff, but it definately could have been more interesting.
-NEEDS MORE EVENTS. This for me is this biggest flaw of this DLC. This game needs more events full stop.
-A big problem for me is your vassels asking for artifacts too often, and if you refuse, you lose 60 opinion. This should be a court plea, or an event that triggered when you hold court with even worse consequences. I played and had the roman empire, I was getting spammed so much for artifacts i just kept clicking and closing them.
-Another huge issue is getting spammed about item durability. If you have a large empire, I had no joke at one point, 175 artifacts. And it seems that when you switch rulers or something, they lose durability even more because non-stop notifcations for it was just crazy. It got to the point where I would just close them all and have them be destroyed. The game shouldnt make you want to feel like you dont want to deal with your conquest rewards. You need to do something different with your items system.
-Missed opportunities in general. A few court roles I think are missing. For instance a jailer that maybe gives you dread and makes it less likely people escape from your jail. Grandeur in the form of grandeur events, or getting to choose specific things like culture dishes you serve, or types of fashion.
-Bugs. Some current bugs I ran into playing. Sometimes when renaming artifacts, it just wont let you because it says the name is too long, no matter what you type. Sometimes the screen flashes white when you clicking into the court. I had a bug where it said i was making negative 3 gold per month, and i was gaining around 12 gold per month. One or two others i forget at the moment, but were there.
-A final general problem, the spymaster role is boring, uninteresting, and needs reworking or additions. I very much enjoy the added abilities to the marshal, diplomat, and steward. The spymaster is very annoying, and also spams alot with useless information all the time. It needs to have one or two more actions that help give it more depth.


Overall I did enjoy my time playing the game and I do think it adds to the overall enjoyment of the game, however it does need to be reworked some and improved upon.

What I would like to see for future update and content

-The pope needs a rework. You should be able to destroy the pope for good even if you are christian. It kind of makes no sense he just survives for forever. Like I said before you could even add colosseum update in the same update as the pope since its the same location.
-Lots of events. More more more events for everything.
-More fun things to do with the northman. I havnt played them but from my understanding they dont get courts. I dont have a desire to play them because they have less to do.
-I think two more counselers should be added to the game. One of them should be Hand of the king/queen. This is an event where you get a minor bonus, but i think it could be a council member. One of its abilities could be to antagonize someone, making them more likely to attack you, or even them losing prestige. Royal engineer or something along those lines would be the second one. This would deal with artifacts and buildings and stuff. He would have the option to increase build time, search for artifacts, ect. This would get rid of the spam of ppl saying they have inspirations, which i think should also be a hold court event, and not just pop up all the time. It gets annoying.
-More stuff for the east, and additionally add more of the world/map. Would like to see a more fleshed out map and more focus on asian culture.
-Once again as i mentioned before, jousting tournaments. But please have them be alittle indepth with lots of events. I think the dueling system could help and go with it so thats a decent bit of the work done, but it needs to have options and lots of events to be fun. Also maybe special court positions for knights that joust ect.


ALSO i almost forgot. Counts should be able to make court pleas to the king. Makes no sense that a count cant make demands of a king, even if they are less likely to succeed.

Oh and one final thing, WAY MORE CLOTHING AND ACCESSORIES to make characters look cool and feel unique.

"123","110999442","110999442","english","I can tell a lot of work was put into this, particularly in the art department for modeling and rendering those court rooms. Though I have some hard-hitting thoughts. All of this was written from the perspective of a Pre-Y1K Ireland playthrough. And specifically, I couldn't bring myself to play longer than a single character's lifespan. I'll explain, in detail, why I couldn't. The short of it is how everything unravels overnight.

The one biggest disappointment with this expansion in particular is that I'm struggling to have my artifact sword build a reputation for mass slaughter in duels. (I can't have it win battles since the Commander of an Army does not count for being an active Knight.) Could've sworn that was a selling point, unless I missed something in the fine print. Because I wanted to get a blue ""famed"" weapon not from the craftsmanship, but from having it survive a hundred battles.
I really, REALLY like the idea of Artifacts being super precious and awesome, though looting the most developed empires seems a lot more profitable than building a locally commissioned sword, reforging it over the span of decades, and using that sword to slay all the enemies across both Britain *AND* France! I mean it, I want MY sword to grow into something more legendary and epic than just ""I pillaged some king with my levy of 20,000 peasants"". The same mindset could be applied to the other fields and types of artifacts (crown for holding diplomatic court, for example, or just having a huge territory being affiliated with my smithed Irish Crown yet that crown still feels puny when I have an empire to rival the biggest and best of the age).

The dueling, too...With ridiculous prowess, having tailored my character SPECIFICALLY to be an unbeatable God of War (even IN ""Achievement Mode"" where your ruler designer can still have one or two REALLY GOOD traits within their 400 point threshold), duels never ended before 3 or 5 action menus. Not even when my score was ""Excellent"" and I was against an aging Pope who had 0 Prowess! The way the information tries to convey how you're doing feels *RANDOM!* One time, same battle with the Pope, it'd tell me ""We're evenly matched"" and ALSO say ""My form is near flawless, yet his is a disaster."" How does that MAKE ANY SENSE?!

And for the final blow, when running the debug for the duel mechanic (which has a cute Yu-Gi-Oh reference, by the way, something you won't see in normal play), my ""God of War"" has ACTUALLY DIED in dueling against those fools. HOW! I mean, I guess that Martial focus branch was right in saying, ""Luck can win a duel, and a fool can win a battle."" But when the Prowess disparity is close to 100, I can't help but yell, ""COME ON!""

And I noticed that no matter what the skill level of my councilor, the side effects never fired off (most specifically the martial ""train"" option to improve commanders, I never saw any of them actually improve even when I used debug powers to give a 50/50 chance of an improvement every month or year or whatever the in-game length of time was meant for).

Speaking of debug, if you think it'd be fun to play as God in this game with console commands, I have to be honest...that gets about as fun as a data entry job. When going full God mode, I find more time typing in the commands to make my whole court immortal than I do steamrolling whole dutchies and reuniting Brittania before the year 900. Admittedly, that's not how Crusader Kings is intended to be experienced, but still, keep that in mind if you ever get so frustrated that you want to show the computer who's boss.

Debug has other cute little Easter Eggs, like ""Errorhoof"" as a reference to ""Glitterhoof"" from Crusader Kings 2. Honestly, I absolutely MISS having a LITERAL ""THUNDERHORSE"" in my court! It gave such great Dethklok vibes, but I get that Crusader Kings 3 is emphasizing ""nothing overtly supernatural"", but still...a shame we lost such an awesome horse.

In all playthroughs, you are allowed only ONE God-tier character, and it shows. Without turning Crusader Kings into a data entry job, you can't modify your starting spouse, your children WILL get WATERED-DOWN congenital traits if your spouse has none (like the one *I* play as would have ""Herculean"" AND ""Pure Blooded"", the spouse has neither, then our SON would have ""Hale"" and NOT ""Pure Blooded""). That's even WITH the dynasty perks focusing on breeding the best bloodline. So the only way to prevent this watering-down is absolute sibling-level inbreeding, which as you already know, will give the Inbred trait somewhere. Yet when matched with ""Herculean"", ""Genius"", AND ""Beautiful"", ""Inbred"" and ""Genius"" put together is basically a net-zero, meaning they cancel each other out so you get the same outcome as a common peasant in  terms of raw capability. I presume this is Paradox doing their strict ""Game Balancing"", but it's, again, NOT FUN! It also shows you get only ONE God-tier character, so might as well pack it up when that character dies.

Achievements...most of them are ridiculously specific, and that's not even counting how strict Paradox as a development studio is about what qualifies for ""Achievement Mode"". You can't debug a save, turn off debug, then load that save; it still won't count for achievements. Gotta hand it to them for thinking of EVERYTHING, but man it's frustrating. Don't play this game for the achievements.

Maintaining the court's ""Grandeur"" is a PAINFUL money sink, and with my God-tier character (both in ""Achievement Mode"" AND ""Debug Mode""), my entire dominion falls to pieces the very moment my character DIES OF OLD AGE! Maybe it's historically accurate for a dynasty of 200 to 500 strong to see inevitable infighting and power vacuums, and also historically accurate for my groomed heir to have a FRACTION of the income as Dear Ol' Ma-an-Pa, or for the land to get cut up and divided among numerous heirs (a problem NOT in Stellaris, which I found more broadly appealing even though I truly want to like Crusader Kings for its more GRANULAR approach to empire-scale strategy and conquest, doubly when Stellaris doesn't let you duel your neighboring emperors to the death in toe-to-toe sword fights OR spar with your Vassals, OR give you the power to rob the weird tentacle aliens of the artifacts they have claimed). On all counts, I imagine that's the way it's supposed to be, though it isn't FUN when my God character creates an indomitable empire with the #1 court in the world, then it all falls apart the moment that character dies. It might as well be GAME OVER at that point, even though that's not the point of Crusader Kings (the POINT is to see your whole LEGACY play out). It's just seeing my work get undone is NOT FUN! 

The dialogue boxes are very plentiful, though after a while, I get tired of every in-game month (roughly 10 seconds of REAL time) having to pause because there are FIVE schemes at court involving random Courtiers, or my WIFE wants to murder my Physician. We're all on the same side, so why are you killing the best doctor in the land?

While Steam forces me to a binary decision on ""Do you Recommend"", I totally see where it'd get ""mixed"" reviews, and I'm kinda on the fence myself. The only reason I'm going with ""Yes"" is because I absolute appreciate the ""A for Effort"" that Paradox so far has earned. The core is HERE, it's that there is a GREAT amount of room for improvement.

Please, Paradox, improve this expansion!",1645813099,1645813099,TRUE,0,1,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198199789389",188,32,0,0,NA,0

This game has a particular niche, imo, this niche does not care much about cosmetics (more for the die hards).
Give us game content, not cosmetic trash (Resources better spent). 

The update as a whole is pretty great. It expands a lot, and allows a lot more player choice.

The DLC however, seems a bit unfinished with repeating court events (Lacking in variety).
I'm sure a mod already exists to broaden them. Patches should fix this.

I'd recommend royal court, building your empire by synergising your culture/religion is quite fun.

Also visually looks bad. The price really is the main issue. Also, for some reason they excluded tribal civilizations from having throne rooms, even though there's no logical reason. They already get significantly less than the feudals. The Khanates, Nords, and African tribes would absolutely have a throne room equivalent. Even then, a high ranking vassal would have a type of throne/main room. Legit can't use the main features unless you're a king or emperor. :(

I am a long time PDX and CK fan and have almost all DLCs...except say EU IV for clear reasons of quality. CK 2 DLC even near the end was fantastic. Way of Life added SO much and that was quite late in the lifespan. 

This, this is the most expensive PDX DLC I've ever seen and it's a FRACTION of the content any old DLC ever offered. It's not even a 1/10th as enjoyable or meaningful. I'll be honest, I think it was falsely advertised. They showed lots of images in the dev diaries clearly making it LOOK like there would be animations of drawing daggers etc. in the court. No...nothing. The court is a dead, static place with literally no movement or life AT ALL.

It's the core of this mod and you almost never open it, not to mention the court is optimised terribly and makes a 3070 kick up to 99% utilisation for no reason. So now CK 3's excellent performance is dropping in quality also. It took them a year and a half to make a 3D room that looks the same no matter what grandeur level you are. No seriously, what have they actually been doing in this time?

By now CK 2 would have had nearly 4 DLCs with an insane amount more content even in ONE of them. Merchant republics perfect example. That took a few months in comparison. Nothing this DLC adds is actually useful. It's tiny stat bonuses. It adds no depth, no more enjoyment, nothing. It's a damn good thing CK 3 is really fun as it is because this is a SERIOUS misfire for a TWENTY FOUR POUNDS DLC. Insane to even ask that for a SIMS 2 room.

The only thing I will say, is there is a noticeable increase in fun flavour text again after CK 3 base is dry af in its humour and fun compared to CK2. I'm not saying it needs Cthulu, but my God CK3 base needs flavour events badly.

The free features are all you need, don't waste half the cost of a FULL GAME on this hit and miss. You'll forget it's even there in an hour. Not to mention it's KINGS only so if you like to play Count, don't bother at all.

"172","110813924","110813924","english","I just completed a full CK3 game with Royal Court and my feelings are... mixed! But, I enjoyed myself and found that the additions of Royal Court were more positive than negative, so I'll give it a recommendation. Also of note, I bought the ""Royal Edition"" of CK3 at a reduced cost long before Royal Court came out, which included the DLC, so I didn't get the same sticker shock that most did. These are my thoughts without considering price:

The Good!
- It's a neat idea, being able to see your court and the characters inside it adds a lot of flavor to the game in itself.
- My favorite aspect, the return of ""minor titles"" from CK2 in the form of court duties. Having things like a jester and a cup-bearer adds a nice little extra element. Especially as you expand, you lose track of individual characters, and giving them specific jobs helps create ""I know that guy!"" moments.
- Language and culture feels better than it did originally (though this may be part of the non-DLC patch)
- Most of the events weave into existing things well, such as artifacts coming up in schemes.

The bad!
- Holding court is, unfortunately, a hassle! It's extremely buggy at the moment (many missing characters or actors that don't make sense, i.e. people asking me to take my own daughter in as my own daughter), but even when it works, it's a tedious and unrewarding process that pops up far too often. There's also an issue with repeating events, though this is a problem with all of CK3 for me (""a snake at court"" and shocking fornicator secrets happen dozens of times per hour)
- Artifacts, while a cool idea, have a lot working against them. Durability is a nagging issue, vassals constantly demand artifacts from you (not only annoying, but very damaging to relationships), and the interface (particularly in court and gifting) is very awkward and disfunctional.
- I'm unsure how it will evolve. It seems like the idea of Royal Court is good, but it's buggy and could use a lot more.. everything. Since it's DLC and not a required part of the main game, it seems like they'll either have to integrate it (defeating the purpose of buying this) or ignore it in future updates and DLC. And, since it's Paradox, we all know there will be a lot more DLC.

So, overall, I'm recommending Royal Court with a sentiment of ""I like the game more with it than without it"". It always sounded like an ambitious idea while it was being developed, and I don't think they quite delivered what I hoped it was going to be, but.. that's kind of how I feel about everything Paradox does!

"180","110799857","110799857","english","Short: Do NOT buy this DLC if you play mostly Tribal cultures like the Norse or Africans. DO buy this DLC if you play feudal and clan cultures. 

Long: This DLC brings four main additions to the base-game: royal courts, cultural acceptance, hybrid cultures, and extra traditions. 

The Royal Court is geared mostly for Kings and Emperors. Dukes and counts don't get courts, but they can visit the court of their royal/imperial lieges and petition them for one thing or another. As a king/emperor, you get a snazzy throne room where you can spend money on various amenities, artifacts, and courtiers. All three provide *huge* bonuses to prestige, renown, approval, taxes, levies, dread, and a variety of other factors--assuming you generate enough income to cover the burgeoning expenses of your kingdom/empire.  

Culture received a major overhaul. Play nice with a culture, giving land and titles to that culture? Its people will accept you, giving you approval bonuses and even a chance to hybridize. This will allow you pick out the ethos and traditions from two cultures as you create a brand new one. Keep attacking the nobles of a culture, never letting any of them hold titles? Be prepared for stiff approval penalties from both nobles and the general public. You can reduce these penalties through steward projects and learning the local language.

A couple extra traditions round off this DLC, allowing you to mold your culture to better suit your playstyle. While some traditions can be found in the base game, there are the new ones that are particularly interesting. Infinite kingdom-level holy wars, +25 development when building/replacing structures, easily convince unwanted heirs to take religious vows while they're still children... these are just some examples of the added traditions with a huge impact to your game.

Oh, and there's the flavor text you get from Royal Court events. Most of these events are procedural, making you choose one option or the other. Some of them are also bugged, with names not appearing. Annoying, but not game-ending for an ironman run. It's the narrative-driven events that are the real treat, like a cult chasing after the missing skull of their beheaded messiah. 

In conclusion, Royal Court is an excellent if pricy addition to Crusader Kings 3.

Royal Court is an interesting DLC because it's well made, but it just doesn't add enough actual content to the game to recommend it at its current price point. The Court is a mostly ignoreable feautre and frankly I find that it gives you more debuffs or problems than it solves. It's really only in there for RP purposes.

Artifacts are good, but at the end of the day they're just a money sink and you'll end up with an infinite number of them about 100 years into the game once your economy is moving.

The culture mechanic is cool, but also pretty OP/obvious to take since there's virtually 0 downside from merging cultures.

Now as for the actual content I love how there is actually things to spend money on. After the first 40-50 years of the game it feels slow and there is not much to do by the time you get to your third character,so having more things to spend money own is awesome. In addition,having a real use for prestige to add traditions and reform culture is awesome you dont sit there with thousands of prestige wasting away. Having a royal court to see your dynasty grow in power and legend over the centuries feels like your thrown into the world which adds immersion. The addition of court positions makes so much sense given the importance of multiple roles in imperial sociteties that would hold influence. The negatives I have of this are as follows. The court grandure is EXTREMELY annoying. Feels like no matter how much you up it nothing matters and it will drop regardless of how much money you put into it. The models need to be flushed out feels pixilated at times and they look sloppy compared to the court room itself. Lastly the fact tribal nations cannot use the court system but can still have items is stupid. Like what is the point of allowing some features and not others either all or none.

"209","110748089","110748089","english","This expansion goes into the category ""good idea, but poor execution"" category. I do not find it necessary to comment on the price or Paradox DLC policy and do not really take that into the account of my review. I will let that be up to the judgement of the readers.

Royal Court allows you to interact with your subject by holding court. It also allows you to display artifacts which will give you various bonuses. This is all good, but holding court gets tedious very quickly when those reminders keep popping up and you have the same events happening over and over again. This DLC needs way more events to work out properly. It would be interesting to also see more events that can make an impact on the gameplay. For example you could allow your subjects to construct a holding or establish a merchant's guild. However, most of the time, the events are small and rather insignificant. Could be that is how it is to be a ruler, but CK3 is also a strategy game.

And that is where this expansion is not doing its job. The whole Court Grandeur system feels meaningless. There are ten different levels to go through and with bonuses you can get by attaining different levels. You can also choose between different types of courts to get different bonuses. All good in theory, but in practice it feels like there are only 2-3 levels. There is not much strategy involved in advancing the level of your court. It depends solely on your gold income so it is very easy to increase the level of your court. It would have been more interesting if there would have been other requirements and benefits in place to make this a bit more challenging. 

So in short the expansion adds too little for those into RP (events) and too little depth for those who are more into strategy.  The ideas in here are good, but an expansion is supposed to add to the longevity of the game. There is just not that much new here that would add many hours of content to the game. 

Even after half a playthrough I feel like I have seen most of what Royal Court has to offer. What I have seen is not bad, but I wanted to see more.

Par où commencer ? Déjà, je vais préciser une chose, tout le contenu de la MAJ ne fait pas partie du DLC. J'ai vu certaines personnes mettre une éval positive en mentionnant les artefacts par exemple, sauf que cela risque d'induire en erreur les gens.

Le contenu associé à ce DLC c'est la salle du trône, les événements liés à elle, ainsi que la possibilité de réformer, diverger ou fusionner des cultures. C'est tout. Les artefacts, le rework du système des cultures, le système des langues et leur apprentissage, les nouveaux postes de la cour, tout ça c'est lié à la MAJ GRATUITE, donc n'allez pas acheter le DLC si c'est ce qui vous intéresse.

[h1] Ceci étant éclairci, que vaut le DLC ? [/h1]

Pour ma part, je dénote trois gros points négatifs :

[u] Premier point [/u] : Le contenu, forcément. 30 balles pour une modélisation de la cour, qui n'offre guère de personnalisation en plus. Au niveau des événements, y en a des intéressants, je ne saurais dire s'il y en a en grand nombre ou pas, mais au bout de quelques heures j'en avais déjà qui revenait souvent.

Et pour rester sur le point du manque de contenu, je rajouterais qu'en plus, la salle du trône n'a même pas été totalement exploité. Je m'en suis rendu compte en tombant sur un mod du workshop, qui rajoute la possibilité de célébrer son mariage dans la salle du trône, et là je me suis dis ""mais oui!"". Pourquoi Paradox n'y a pas pensé ? Cela rajouterait une plus-value sur du contenu déjà existant, et ça pourrait même en rajouter davantage. Imaginez pouvoir organiser des banquets dans sa salle du trône par exemple.

Non seulement la salle du trône n'apporte pas grand-chose, mais en plus elle n'a même pas été pleinement exploitée.

[u] Deuxième point [/u] : L'implémentation et l'intérêt du DLC dans le jeu de base. Pour faire simple, quand vous achetez le DLC et que vous lancez une partie, au final, il se passe quoi de particulier ? Vous jouez comme vous jouez d'habitude, et parfois vous allez avoir un élément du DLC qui va venir vous rappeler que oui vous avez claqué de la thunes juste pour ça. 

Vous pouvez accorder une audience tous les 5 ans, donc tous les 5 ans vous allez écouter les doléances des gens, ce qui se traduit par un système tout à fait similaire aux événements que l'on a régulièrement. Ils sont différents évidemment (heureusement), et certains sont drôles, d'autres intéressants, j'ai par exemple eu un dirigeant étranger venu me demander qu'il devienne mon vassal, c'est sympa, mais dans l'idée c'est des événements comme on en connaît déjà dans le jeu de base.

Parfois vous aurez un événement, hors audience accordé, qui va pop, mais ça reste un événement, avec un petit synopsis et des choix à faire.

Ce DLC n'apporte fondamentalement rien qui requiert réellement l'attention du joueur au-delà de quelques minutes de temps à autre, hormis pour une mécanique en particulier, mais je vais y revenir, et cela est du en partie au fait que : c'est trop facile.

La mécanique principale de la salle  du trône, c'est de devoir gérer le niveau de magnificence de la cour, le niveau de grandeur, sauf que c'est beaucoup trop facile. Il n'y a même pas réellement besoin de la gérer. À partir du moment où vous gagnez assez d'argent, vous augmentez les frais, engagez des gens à certains postes clés, et voilà, c'est bon, plus besoin de s'en préoccuper outre mesure.

[u] Troisième point [/u] : Donc la mécanique dont je parlais un peu avant c'est : la réforme, la divergence et le métissage des cultures. C'est probablement la mécanique la plus intéressante qu'offre ce DLC, et ce n'est en fait pas une si bonne chose que ça.

Là encore je vais y revenir, mais de tous les ajouts, c'est peut être celui qui va accaparer le plus votre attention, parce que déjà c'est une mécanique que je trouve ultra intéressante, de pouvoir en quelques sorte créer des build de cultures en piochant dans celles des autres (et l'intérêt va en être considérablement augmenté avec les flavor pack qui rajouteront des mécaniques propres à chaque culture) mais cela va vous coûter cher en prestige, vous allez donc chercher à en obtenir toujours plus ce qui vous donnera un objectif à moyen terme, mais en plus vous allez tout mettre en oeuvre pour que l'acceptation culturelle soit assez haute pour que la fusion des cultures puisse se produire. Demander à votre conseiller de travailler là-dessus, éviter de déclencher des guerres entre vos cultures, augmenter l'acceptation via les événements aléatoires etc.

Bref, c'est certainement la meilleure mécanique du DLC, mais si je disais un peu avant que ce n'est pas forcément une bonne chose, c'est parce qu'en fait je trouve que cette mécanique n'a rien à voir avec l'idée du DLC qui est la Cour Royale. 

Ça ne concerne pas la gestion de la cour en fait, et le pire, c'est que ce n'est pas réellement du contenu ajouté par le DLC, mais plutôt du contenu bloqué dans le jeu de base, dont le DLC va permettre de débloquer.

Si on compare ça avec les religions, c'est comme si dans le jeu de base vous aviez les religions, mais que pour les réformer ou en créer de nouvelles, il fallait acheter un DLC. Et donc j'en viens à ma théorie perso : je pense qu'ils ont mis ça dans le DLC parce qu'en fait, sans ça, il aurait un contenu totalement rachitique. C'est déjà pas fameux avec, mais sans, je crois qu'on pourrait clairement parler de DLC inutile. Là, ça va créer une espèce de frustration de ne pas avoir accès à une mécanique hyper intéressante, et donc ça va pousser à acheter [b] LE DLC [/b] , qui, si vous ne l'aviez pas compris après ce pavé, [b] NE VAUT CLAIREMENT PAS 30 EUROS. [/b]

J'ai mis un pouce bleu au DLC des Vikings, malgré un contenu malingre, parce que le prix n'était pas abusé, même si un poil exagéré peut-être, mais là c'est non, juste non. Un gros non.

Ceci dit, histoire de nuancer un peu, je reconnais volontiers le travail énorme fourni pour la MAJ Fleur-de-Lis. Oui, le rework du système des cultures, l'implémentation des artefacts, des langues, l'acceptation culturelle, le travail sur la forme comme sur le fond, est énorme, je ne dis pas le contraire, et il faut bien avouer que c'est plaisant de voir que, même avec le modéle économique des DLC, Paradox bosse sur ses MAJ gratuites et ne laisse pas sur le carreau les gens qui ne vont pas acheter les DLC, MAIS, ça ne justifie pas le prix du DLC. 

Au final le plus grand intérêt de la salle du trône, c'est ce que cela apportera grâce aux mods. Les salles du trône des univers du seigneur des anneaux, game of thrones et j'en passe. En tant que machine à fan service ça va être énorme.

Donc moi ce que je vous dis, c'est que non, ça ne vaut pas 30 euros, mais par contre, si ça fait un moment que vous n'avez pas relancé le jeu, et que vous attendiez le DLC pour ça, ben en fait n'achetez pas le DLC mais profitez de la MAJ gratuite qui, elle, apporte beaucoup, et justifie de relancer une nouvelle partie.

Where the (very affordable) Northern Lords flavour pack brought a tonne of new features, events, lore, and world-building, which each felt impactful within the game, the Royal Court feels completely like an add-on that doesn't really add much that's substantial to the gameplay experience.

Within the Royal Court interface (which you can only access by leaving the campaign map, which doesn't help with making it feel integrated), you simply see a bunch of people standing around, alongside some artefacts that you can choose to display. And it feels thoroughly disappointing to see your court like this.

Councillor side effect/events have been disabled entirely. 

Courts are bland and have very little content, the events just repeat every couple of decades, meaning after a single character you've seen 90% of the events.

Court positions are just a chore, you have to constantly rehire new ones every 2-3 years for the 20 positions, and you have to keep checking which positions are vacant as people die or just leave.

You can't hybridise culture with any culture of the same heritage, for example if you're playing as Welsh and want to hybridise with Cornish to grab their ancient miner tradition... You can't. Even though hybridising is the only way to get that tradition, and Welsh and Cornish don't share any traditions, so their reasoning of cultures are too ""similar"" when they don't share a single tradition or pillar and one of them has an entirely unique tradition. This makes it easier for a Chinese culture to get ancient miners from Cornish vs their Welsh neighbours that speak the exact same language and are supposed to share the same heritage.

I can see what they're trying to do, but it just doesn't work. They tried their best to polish it and avoid the disasters that EU4 and Surviving Mars suffered, but it still has bugs and while they aren't game breaking they do make the game more bland than ever, not to mention the best part of the DLC the artefacts are a constant source of spam, as anyone related to you will demand everything you have and if you refuse you've just made an enemy for life, and you might face a full on revolt for not handing over your book of poems. I even had a distant cousin demand my crown while I was emperor, and they only held one county. 

This is the last Paradox game I will be buying, and I will never buy a DLC from them again, even when the DLC doesn't break the game with bugs it just makes it so bland that you don't want to play any more.

Immersion-so far what I've seen at court are  trivial or even silly decisions, with annoyingly frequent repetition. I should be able to summon people to court to influence what they are doing i.e. any member of my Council at the very least.  I have no sense of being the ruler of complex realm. The views are few and fixed. I'm really surprised there is no first person view looking out from the throne, that's a lost opportunity. 

Worst of all in my opinion is that I'm always broke with Royal Court. Playing as the King of Poland before the dlc came out I had just enough money to do what I wanted, with some hard choices. Now as King of France a much richer country I can do hardly anything because the court even at a most modest level swallows up so much cash. Paying a gift to the Pope now costs me 3 years national income! I'm not good at this game and no doubt could do better at managing the money, but I don't see why my court eats up as much money as my army.

Anyway preamble aside, i have to leave a negative review for actual reasons related to the game. The main issue is that now i have frequent crashes upon loading a save game where i didn't before (also load times seem longer?). There are also other bugs, yesterday i had one where every time i switched between screens the map mode would default to the culture map view, odd but not exactly game-breaking admittedly. I've also had an issue where my gold was not counting my income, only my expenses, so it was impossible to make money, this might have been due to the hotfix though, but usually they don't mess with save files....

Generally i like what this DLC along with the free update is trying to do, the AI is marginally better for example (will mostly stick to a siege that is almost complete now), but there are bugs and crashes that while not necessarily game-breaking are immersion-breaking at least and really flippin annoying!

"275","110575821","110575821","english","A solid expansion even though most of it makes you feel like it should have been in the initial release. Is it worth buying? Yes. Are there issues? Also yes:

1. Creating your culture does not spread the culture to provinces in a logical way. E.g. you combine dominant Greek with Bavarian. Instead of the Bavarian provinces in the proximity of Greek ones and vice versa converting it only converted a hand full near the coast of cyprus. Which didnt make any sense at all. It also did not affect any more than just one of my 16 domain holdings.
2. AI being able to hybridize can ruin your game. Less dominant cultures can make hybrids with yours since the relation between the two is synched. In my case this meant that the handfull of Bulgarians hybridized with Greek and converted large swaths of my Empire with shitty cultural pillars and they even swapped my entire capital duchy and other important holdings.
3. The Royal Court can be really annoying with the ""holding court"" reminder which you cant really toggle. You also have to spend masses of gold to keep your court grandeur up so that your vassals wont just depose you because mimimi your perfect bread wasnt enough, we want some bread from Mars' soil. 
4. Artifacts are missing some quality of life love. Once you played for a while you will have shitload of trashy artifacts. Sure you could just gift them away or let them crumble. Sadly the latter will most likely cause you to lose important ones as you tend to ignore them. It is unclear to me why there is no toggle for ""keep this artifact intact"" which would cost a tiny monthly cost. Instead you have to scroll through 100 artifacts every couple of years and manually click on multiple buttons to repair them.
5. Artifact space: there is this gigantic hall with so much space but somehow youre limited to only few spots where you can place your artifacts. Id rather have weaker artifacts but more space to display them. Im sure modders will fix this eventually. 
6. Minor court titles: It is pretty annoying if you have not only the 5 major roles but also 22 minor ones to give away.

I've now played Royal Court from count to emperor and the additions, though somewhat welcome, are not worth that price.

- The Court Room
So, I was really excited to get up to the level where I could have a court and that hype landed like a bit of a wet fart. You can't even actually look around your court. I'm not asking for a total free cam but there's not even a basic rotate. Can my court actually look alive too? With my jester juggling, my musician playing etc? Nope. It is extremely dull. They didn't even think of some kind of glamour shot view to look at your artifacts.

- Artifacts
Speaking of artifacts, the interface for putting them in and out is pretty awful, with no comparison tool like many an RPG has when swapping items. And I hope you like renaming the ones you have equipped to remember what they are because when NPCs try to claim them off you, good luck remembering. What's more, you'll end up with a massive stockpile of this crap that you can't even JUST SELL. Nope, ya gotta gift it, so hoarding them does you really no good. I will say it is nifty we now have a system to equip items, it's just janky as heck and the inventory management system is terrible. Oh and I would much rather give solid directions to my artificer than some vague handwave in the general direction of what I want. I have a dozen tapestries and banners and I still only have one small wall object, which I stole.

- Holding Court
Yeah, you'll hate this. Rarely is it anything just good that comes your way when you hold court, unless you are sitting on a mountain of gold to spend on an outcome. The events are very repetitive and most times you'll walk out having spent 100 prestige just to piss off everyone you know.

- Culture
The one solidly implemented aspect is culture and language. I enjoyed making my kids learn the language of their bethrothed spouses to be so they had a better chance at happy marriages. I liked modding my culture and checking out potential hybrids.  It was neat seeing the landscape of the world evolve. This is good.

VERDICT
DLC needs a few big patches. Wait till Royal Court goes on sale for cheap, then snag it. The bonus being that the wonky bits would likely be fixed by then too.

"285","110554505","110554505","english","First of all, I like the idea of this DLC. I always though: Wouldn't it be nice to have a 3d scene with all your courtiers around, now that we have 3d models? Though it certainly never was a top priority for me.
For the sake of this review, let's ignore the price-tag and that maybe this shouldn't have been the first DLC and that it took so long (with almost no patches in between) and just have a look at what you get.

[list]
    [*][b]A 3d court (if you are a king)[/b]:
To be precise 4 of them. Each with a few minor texture variations. The thing is: The game covers an area from portugal to india and tibet, from iceland to the subsaharan africa. There are distinct court representations for western europe, the mediterranean, india and one middle eastern looking one for everyone else. I do understand that there aren't distinct visuals for England vs France, but at the very least there should be a eastern europe (slavic), one asian and (at least!) one african court room. By the way, this has nothing to do with the price, just with the scope of the game requiring it. If it's too much work, then don't make such a DLC. Do it right, or don't do it... 
Speaking of things missing from the 3d court: It doesn't feel alive. Many players report that they rarely look at their court screen, and if you decide to buy this you'll soon understand them. Why? One reason is probably that they didn't invest just a little bit of money into better animations. Also, the sound design for the royal court is off, but I suspect that, to some extend, it might just be bugged: I often don't hear any background music but instead a quite loud and quite low quality background talk recording. Btw, it sounds very much like a latin, so have fun with your indian court...
    [*][b] You can hold court[/b] (and court events):
    Sounds great, right? But I'd recommend you don't click that button. Just don't do it.
    If you do, you'll get 3 petitioners that teleport into your 3d court (because having characters walk around in a 3d scene is black magic and no one can do such things). There are a few types of petitioners: 
A) The two mayors you have never heard about that have some problems with each other. Actually, these events are probably somewhat accurate and dealing with them was certainly part of a kings job. It would really help though, if the mayors were actually your mayors and not the mayors under some count under some duke of yours, because in that case, you really don't care at all.
B) The meme-guests. They are here to entertain you. At least, maybe the first time you'll see them. Sadly, the number of events is quite limited, so expect them to tell their bad joke more then once.
C) The characters who are totally confused what they are doing there: A big problem with CK3 (and also this expansion) is that there doesn't seem to be any quality control on events and content designers just make stuff up as quickly as possible (and for some reason even that way they don't event have loads of court events...) and don't think about which event would make sense for which character. So you're wife, the queen will be accused of eating from the royal cake. Your 3-year old son will be accused of being a drunkard, neglecting his duties and fighting your courtiers. You daughter will petition you to take care of her son ""who's dear mama went missing"" - seriously? Aside from these obvious examples, there are quite a few more where characters aren't entirely out of place but certainly acting against their personality and thus breaking immersion.
The DLC also comes with great, important decisions like ""change court fashion/architecture"", which do nothing except for giving you a minor modifier. Cool!
    [*][b]Artefacts[/b]
Loads of artefacts. Expect to be bombarded with them. Of course, the interface gets cluttered with them quickly and they'll just become a hassle. Despite the vision of ""not have OP artefacts"", a few went under the radar and for example give you the totally sensible superpower of (almost) immortality. Others are just boring. Yeah, balance is a problem in CK3.
Oh and by the way, if you expected the presentation of artefacts in the court room to be cool I'll have to disappoint you. Most of them have generic models (a chest containing stuff, a weapon rack, a diamond). At least a little bit better than crowns which of course your character won't actually wear (because they have no 3d model). Most artefacts in your court feel a bit out of place. Its a court, no a treasury. Also, they decided that you get stat modifiers from the artefacts displayed at your court, so they had to severely limit the number of artefacts you can have at display. And you can only place them at specific slots, so you cannot have a nice looking arrangement of realm/dynasty banners behind your throne.
    [*]Culture Customisation
    If you feel like it, you can customise your culture. Like religious customisation, its more of a once in a playthrough thing to make your culture/religion kind of OP or super weird, but hybrid cultures are quite nice when playing a viking and conquering a realm elsewhere. 
   Be warned though, the AI might go a little bit crazy with that feature.
    [*][b]Grandeur[/b]
    Nice idea. You can get maximum level grandeur (and insane boni) in 20 years if you have a small kingdom for almost no cost. If your kingdom is large, good luck, because the amenity costs will scale depending on the size of your realm (measured in #counties, not development). It's totally unbalanced, but maybe they'll balance it eventually. Though, to be honest, they haven't balanced the base game features yet, so I'm not very hopeful on that. 
   [*][b]Languages[/b]:
   Courts have a court language. Not very important, but this feature exists. 
   Languages in itself are a pretty underused feature in general: First of all, you'll need a personal scheme to learn a language, it's gonna take ages and be kind of weird. Then, speaking a language could have far more useful effects. Also, for some reason PDX decided to ignore that most of medieval europe spoke latin and therefore, literally no one in medieval europe speaks latin. Great.
[/list]
When RC was announced, you might have expected some other features, such as court intrigue features and all kinds of celebrations, from feasts to coronations, funerals and weddings. Yeah, you'll get none of that. Btw, I made a mod to add weddings and it took just a few hours to make, but they had over one year to work on it and did nothing like that. 

Note that the coat of arms designer and the culture overhaul base game features and no reason to buy this DLC.
Should you buy it: Nope. Wait for some time and only buy it if its on sale, they've fixed at least the most obvious problems it has and delivered some missing content post release.

I understand that developing requires money (one reason used to defend the exorbitant price tag) but that should be put into the perspective that this is DLC, it's half the price of the base game. And do you get new content half of the base game? Absolutely not. And games+DLC should be sold by volume, not few at insane price. Both will yield the same income. Unless the company is greedy as EA which quite frankly, Paradox has become. And this little addition took a year from a actual game developers! Either they had just few people working on this or the team REALLY didn't hurry making it. Part-time modders would have made the same in half the time.

The additions themselves are fine (unlike the previous ridiculous OP Viking DLC) but the price should be half at most. What's scary is that the 'Paradox-method' of putting out DLC's in ever increasing pace and the price is already this high!

SO MUCH content and SO MANY mechanics have been added with this expansion. And I'm not just talking about culture, which is pretty huge on its own. Most of the changes were introduced with little hype or fanfare: you only know they're there by playing the game. That's where the value of this expansion is imnsho. 

But the expansion is called ROYAL COURT. Paradox has been hyping the court to no end and it's the most visible thing they're selling. And the royal court itself is by far the weakest and most uninspired part of the expansion -- a HUGE missed opportunity. 

The mechanics and content behind the scenes add complexity and depth to the game. The royal court, on the other hand, stands out for its trivial, shallow mechanics. The court is so shallow mechanically, in fact, that I find it breaks immersion and detracts from the story making experience that CK3 is all about. Again, the court was an disastrous missed opportunity. It coulda, shoulda been so much more. 

CONCLUSION: I give Royal Court an equivocal thumbs up. Up because real depth HAS been added with this expac.

I'm just...a little bit confused. 
  I don't understand how the amount of time required to pull this DLC off was a worthwhile endeavour if this is all that's offered by the final experience?
  The actual content is fine, no problem with it really. It's just that it has quite a hefty price tag for a DLC of this size and what you do get would be better suited to a free update that launched alongside a DLC pack that actually changes up the gameplay a significant amount. As it is, Royal Court only really offers a distraction and can be completely ignored. Furthermore when you do engage in the royal court's systems, you'll more often than not come across an event sequence that penalises you for engaging with it, with an unbalanced number of choices that lead to penalties (often a resource, such as gold), which can feel like a punch in the gut when you're already struggling to balance income with the new costs that this content brings to the game (on top of every other expense you already have in vanilla CK3). 

I feel like the devs could have spent a lot more time fine tuning a experience people wouldn't want to ignore, if they didn't need to break apart and rebuild their code to make these 3D courts etc work. I would be more than happy with a set of 2.5D court screens, it's not like the 3D ones look particularly impressive. They certainly don't compare to the artist's renditions seen as backdrops for your ruler's portrait/character screen. 

What's also odd (aesthetically) is the inclusion of artefacts and treasures inside the court. It just looks blimin lame having peasants from the city come in and stand next to a precious and highly valuable treasure. When playing multiplayer I noticed a friend of mine had nabbed a valuable ring that when it was displayed in his court was represented by a pile of gold coins and gems that were on the floor by people's feet and looked like a splatter of vomit. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 

So yeah, all that development time...That price tag...And yet the flavor pack held my attention far longer and was way more enjoyable. 

Good luck for the next DLC of this size, dev team.",1645226923,1645226923,FALSE,6,0,"0.583575963973999023",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197972471142",252,10,0,0,NA,0

It's ridiculous, and my only suspicion is they want to sell the ""Royal Edition"" making this price a teaser imo. The DLC itself is a nice addiction but holy shit is it lacking in almost everyway. Artifacts suck and are glorified modifiers, events are rehashed and constantly reused, finally are able to create COA without mods but is lacking and should have been included in the base game. Nothing new was added, it uses already created assets from the base game but didnt have an interface to make one, which took over a year to come along. Cultures really are the only thing that are great from this update which really brings a more personalized playstyle which is great for the longevity and modability of the game. All in all I give this DLC a 4/10. They really need to focus on having actual content that the player can use and make it more malleable like the culture system.

Every five years I have to decide whether to spend 100 points to hold a court (I would like a button to turn the court off … delegate it to the queen or prince as I have chosen to become a recluse because of stress or my character is shy) god it’s so boring. As it will have been said many times by now and will in the future it adds nothing, no it takes away, the Norse legacies are gone from the game, why god only knows!

Artefact’s, what a waste of time, they are supposedly a rare item well they come at you so fast and so many you are convinced that they are the medieval equivalent of pizza leaflets. I give mine away as fast as I get them, I don’t worry about it, I will get another in a few game turns yes that’s how rare they are. The modifies on them are just not worth the hassle, 2 prowess and so forth, and yes other leaders in the game will go to war over this nonsense, oh you can make your own say for 100 gold which you then give to a noble who may rebel, and for this you will change their opinion of you by 5 but give them the 100 gold the opinion is changed by 20 to 30, where is the logic in that. What a waste of time.

Culture changes are a modifying bonus again supposedly for you all lands, well yes and no I can see what is meant to happen but it just becomes a mishmash of cultures everywhere, I changed my culture three times it did not unite my lands if anything it divided them.

It is not recommended, if you do succumb to the hype you will be left wondering what on earth you paid for, smoke and mirrors, wait until it is fixed for god only knows it cannot be left like this.

There are other complaints about the game now like the army commander going missing just before your battles but I think that’s more to do with the new  Fleur-de-Lis update.

Artefacte gab es schon zu CK 2 und somit kein wirklicher Aufwand das mit einzubauen.

Modders are already hard at work expanding the court features to include tribal rulers, weddings, and lesser courts; but that is a reminder that those features are not included by Paradox. The culture overhaul is very good and reflects history more than the previous idea of static ""national"" cultures. The new artifact system already comes with the ability to steal artifacts via the diplomacy skill tree.

Despite these good things, the flagship court systems introduced are too static, infrequent, repetitive, and too disconnected from court events outside of the court screen. Currently the base game 2d event screens feel more dynamic than the 3d court scene, since you currently have minimal control over court architecture, there is no artifact search function, the court fashion decision does not change what your courtiers wear, and food and servants do not appear. In sum, Royal Court feels like early access.

I would recommend this on sale if modders and Paradox expand the court features and framework with more unique events, scenes, and architecture. Since that hasn't happened yet, I would not recommend buying at full price.",1645154302,1645154302,FALSE,0,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198055210137",38,5,0,0,NA,0

This DLC is good. I recommend it to anyone who likes CK 3, because I like the new features. The royal court is a good addition to the game. It needs more events and I am sure those will come. The new mechanic for cultures are interesting and create a more believable world, where peoples mixed on a regular basis.

The free patch makes it even better. Finally we have a real inventory! If you are uncertain about what is free and what is paid look it up in the patch notes 1.5 on the CK 3 Wiki.

Metatalk:
I rather play the game than writing a review. But this is DLC deserves a vote of confidence. Most negative reviews here are about the price and that is a disservice to the community. Everyone has to decide what their acceptable price is. You can argue all you want about fair prices. Nobody is forced to buy the DLC right now. Paradox DLCs are in sale very often. I recommend to everyone displeased about the price to do a bit of introspection, reflecting about whether they would have given a negative review, if all free content would be DLC-exclusive. Because technically that would improve the price performance measure.

Paradox could alter their strategy to make all new features free and create a digital supporter pack for each release instead of giving some features away for free and others in a paid DLC. Paradox could then charge whatever prices they see fit for such supporter packs and I will still buy them without any direct material benefit whatsoever. Although I might gain a miniscule amount of satisfaction over the lack of negative reviews from the casualized and entitled portion of the user base, who are besmirching the reputation of these great games captivating my attention over years.",1645128985,1645207682,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197998600614",272,4,0,0,NA,0

This DLC costs more than half as much as the base game, do you get half as much more content again? No. Do you get a  quarter as much? Again... no. A tenth as much? If you played every game specifically and solely trying to maximise your engagement with the mechanics added by this DLC (and thereby removing some of the base content by not touching tribals or rulers lower than King rank)... maybe you could argue this to be the case.

Beyond that, and I concede this is personal preference, the mechanics actually added by this DLC are... well they're not bad but they're honestly pretty meh. Let me put it this way. If I wanted to look at a bunch of awkwardly static people standing around a courtroom I'd go and play Mount and Blade, at least then there's the possibility of getting the visceral satisfaction of bashing some of their annoying heads in.

"359","110440410","110440410","english","The honchos that decided what would be the content of this expansion though it was a great idea to shape it around a 3D scene of the Royal Court, something the coders at Paradox don't technically master and as such, took a lot of resources to achieve. 

Besides the point that the 3D image is a useless trinket that could have been made in 2D in 1/20th of the time and that only serves as the background to a mildly interesting management feature of the court that is used as a kind of money sink - and it is unbalanced - the expansion has to offer a very good new cultural redesign, an unbalanced but necessary artifact system and more static events that soon will reach the stage of ""been there, done that"" to the prospective buyer. 

Events can be very good for the emergent story telling if they are well crafted, with different chances in the options based on different variables, with options that only appear half the time, with other options that are devised in a pool where one option is randomly picked to be presented and with options being present only if certain variables are present. Of all this, only the last technique is employed by Paradox, unfortunately. 
Also, events can have checks to not fire in X years, making their appearance more spaced out. In this way the same events can almost ever be different, interesting as presenting different dilemmas and not fire within a small amount of time.

Is the base CK3 game good? Yes, indeed. It is a great blank canvas Paradox must fill with content based on the sound foundations devised. Is the game worse with Royal Court? No, it's better. But...

All in all and compared with DLCs from CK2 like Holy Fury or Conclave that costed 20€,

DLC is some what buggy still, although not game breaking.

3D courts are a nice touch, but not really needed. 

Court system & cultures makes the mid game less of a grind and something to distract from the impending vassal and populist revolts every time you die. However, i think the snowballing may be even greater in the late game. Court roles don't seem to make a significant enough impact but it would suck if you're running ironman mode to be killed by your jester or to open more avenues for people to scheme against you.

"368","110427857","110427857","english","I'm going to recommend this for the long game I plan to play with it - and that's riding on the modding community. As mentioned in other reviews, there are some brand new *systems* introduced with this that aren't part of the free patch. The modders have already started to put things together based on those systems. Over the long run, that's going to enhance my fun with the game. As for the ""as-is"" aspect of the DLC, I'm having fun with it. Yes, there are lots of randos entering my court with issues I'll see once and then never again. I happen to like that, and that's good for me. True, the court default view is clunky, and I'm limited to what I can hang on the walls and what I can display - my aspirations for becoming The British Museum are curtailed - but I do get the buffs from the gear, and I like that part. I don't play with animations, so I can't use the mod that allows a free camera in the court room, so I do miss out on that. 

The settings for my court stylez are disappointing. I just max them out, build a few more farms to support the cost, and I'm on cruise control to awesomeness. The higher levels should have something necessary to unlock them and occasional nerfs from judgmental churchmen or relatives about extravagance to keep them toned down from time to time. If those extravagances also boosted chances of peasant rebellions, then I'd have a reason to go more Spartan in my court. 

The culture blending is great, I love that part and I love taking time to add/remove/change elements of the culture I'm head of. There's a mod to add more culture slots over time, and I'm thinking of giving that one a go... and that puts me back where I started, planning out my long game with the DLC. 

Will the next DLC be US $30? That or more, quite likely. Will it be buggy on release and get better with patches? Undoubtedly. Will there be complaints that it doesn't do enough and, meanwhile, this other mechanic is unaddress? Absolutely. But... will the modders go crazy with it and create add-ons that make it all worth while? YES.

On that score, it falls pretty flat.

We were told it would feel *immersive*. It's not. It's like looking at a lacklustre screenshot of The Sims 2 - minus most of the charm.

3D objects just aren't Paradox's bag, it seems. The thing is, there's no dynamism. If you increase your court spending, it looks the same. Decrease it, it looks the same. You can add objects, sure, but they're from a limited pool and most look the same as the next or very similar. This is what I really don't understand. We're Grand Strategy players, most - if not all of us - will love reading, and the descriptions for these randomised objects are vivid and charming. So why wasn't the Royal Court an interface like the personal inventory is?

Paradox claim it was the 3D court where they sunk all their time, but it's lifeless and vapid. Why didn't they pour all those resources into a brilliant 2D interface - rich in hundreds of 2D representations of court objects - with those colourful descriptions to accompany them? Think how many more events, object portraits, and other things that might have been created in the same time period?

Instead, we got a series of mannequins standing around a bland space that won't change in any meaningful way, which you have to leave the flow of the main game in order to even visit.

Give it a miss, I'd say. But I'm genuinely sorry to say it, because anything that expands the roleplay elements of this amazing game are welcome to me. I just think Paradox should stick to their strengths and do text-based and 2D-object work.

Plus most of the main features which I haven't mentioned are included in the free patch, so obviously I'm not going to review them here when you don't have to fork over $30 to use them! Fortunately, I bought the base game with all the trimmings when it first came out, so the cost was all factored in when I initially purchased it, which takes out the sting somewhat. I couldn't justify buying this separately at this price.

Frankly, I'm more excited to see what the total-conversion modders do with the template they've got! They'll ace the task, of that I'm sure! I can't say the same of Paradox anymore...",1645099269,1645099664,FALSE,89,1,"0.820481836795806885",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197996329243",139,2,0,0,NA,0

Lo que más juego puede dar es el tema de los títulos menores (que estaba en el 2).

Lo único que realmente destaco es el nuevo sistema de culturas (que es parte de la actualización gratuita), y de ahí, la opción de divergir e hibridar culturas (que sí que es parte de la expansión). Y que hayan reimplementado el inventario (que lo mismo, es gratis).

In my view there really are no excuses for that, and any attempts at such are just inexplicable rallying to a company that cares more about its shareholders than its customers. To an extent this is reasonable, and I'm not in the Paradox management chair but this DLC really is god awful for what it is. Its price can only be justified by the bloated development time. 

I believe that there are certainly talented/inspired individuals at Paradox. However, they don't seem to be in control of the scope of long-term development for certain franchises any more (Imperator: Rome, EU 4, and now CK3 sadly). In fact, this experience is very similar to the release of the first (and only) major DLC for I:R albeit that CK3 had a much sturdier foundation. Yet Paradox management seems to have decided that resources where better spent elsewhere as content has been lacking. Northern Lords was an interesting yet minor DLC. However, does it make sense that it took half a year for that to go live? 

Paradox decided to split their dev studios not too long ago and I believe this is the result. Some are good, but some are struggling. The content from the one's that are struggling are seemingly becoming only more hollow and/or incomplete (i.e.  lacking quality control).

Ironically the best part of this DLC is the culture rework and not the royal courts. Royal courts feel underdeveloped due to strange decisions such as no courts for tribal rulers of any kind. Lack of regional flavour for 3D assets and events. Very few events and some of these events requiring conditions to be met, which cuts down the event pool significantly. You will see the same events repeating within a single rulers lifetime (I've gotten the mayor rivalry event multiple times in a row). no real consequences for ignoring your court (Why would I even bother holding court when most of the events lead to negative outcomes when I could just instead refuse to hold court).

"407","110386173","110386173","english","This latest addition to the Crusader Kings saga is a typical example of Paradox's tendency to create content that is lopsided, disjointed and half-baked. If this was an indie outfit making a game on a shoestring budget it would be understandable, but this is a major games developer ten years down the line in a best-selling series who had an opportunity to draw from deep well of player and modder input but instead keeps rehashing the same fundamental errors again and again: abysmal writing (Holy Fury's sainthood line was painful and the devilry of Monks & Mystics was farcical, but at least we didn't have so much in the way of unavoidable fart jokes and meme-baiting pop culture references), poor research and commitment to the setting, woefully unbalanced mechanics, scope overextension (creating vastly more breadth than depth), and features that were clearly developed separately and do not work in concert or are awkwardly inserted into systems for which they were not designed (see the 'language learning' element of the new cultural system, which has been jankily inserted into the 'scheme' mechanic). Where is the pre-release quality control? Such issues with the development culture are thrown into stark relief by the output of unpaid, amateur modders -- some working on their own! -- who continually show up the official Paradox sub-Renaissance Fair content with imaginative, engaging and soulful work.

This DLC is shallow. The latest of Paradox's ambitious, hyped-up ideas which turn out to be poorly executed is the titular royal court. The devs have put a considerable amount of time and effort into getting a 3D physical room in-game; however, this is revealed to be not much more than a visual gimmick, and an at-times ugly and buggy one at that: clipping issues abound, and as a jumble of artefacts are put on display in the middle of the room the court feels less of a functional, lived-in reception area than a poorly-curated art gallery. The royal court is neither necessary, nor particularly interesting; and as the courts don't really differ in any substantial way except appearance and the odd eunuch, once you've seen one court, you've basically seen them all. This is ironic given the effort also put into the new culture system, but since that also essentialises rich and complex cultures into dull, arbitrary building blocks that can be changed on a whim with sufficient mana, you should expect more memetic weirdness than any real-world flavour.

On a personal note, as an historian it pains me to keep seeing media that has something to say about history, but doesn't actually seem to be interested in the field of history itself: most of what it does say is not just wrong, but fundamentally misunderstands the process of history and the basics of anthropology, let alone the material culture of its subjects. At this point I would much rather Paradox stop making games with an historical setting, and instead start doing whatever they like in a fantasy world of their own devising. This would allow the developers the creative freedom that they clearly desire, while freeing them of the difficult work of attempting any kind of historical verisimilitude.

Indeed, there are so many basic 'didn't do their research' moments in this DLC: just off the top of my head, this includes (but is not limited to) the lack of the 'Refined Poetry' tradition in any of the Arabic cultures (despite poetry being the most celebrated and omnipresent art form of medieval Arab culture); to the cold, bare stone walls of the Northern/Western European throne rooms (even the most spendthrift monarch would have at least plastered and whitewashed his walls); to the completely un-medieval (and sometimes immature and immersion-breaking) attitudes present in a significant number of event texts.

Pop history media makes my job so much harder. I was initially grateful that the Crusader Kings series had given people greater awareness of Islamic civilisation; I am less keen now that I am aware that the cost of basic name recognition is a growing pile of inane nonsense.

Is the Royal Court DLC fun? Does it add enjoyable content?

I would say yes to both.

HOWEVER! The price they are asking ($33.99 in my locale) is nearly extortionate, in my opinion. Had I not gotten Royal Court through my ownership of the CK3 Royal edition, I would be requesting a refund. 

The royal court and its associated functions can be useful. The artefacts in particular can be a great way to boost dynastic reknown income. The actual court itself feels like, essentially a cosmetic expression at most - Like being able to see my characters clothes. Aesthetic only. The actual royal court tasks feel boring, same-y, and a chore. The new court positions, like master of horse or jester or architect really should have been base content. The culture changes are the big draw, in my opinion but are not world changing.

To sum up, is this content worth paying for? Yes and no.

So far ck3 has seen alot more love by the developers than pervious games. 
Royal Court is a really good dlc, and it shows they really listened to the reviews of bad dlc cashgrab.
It's not a huge amount of content but, the content changes alot.
Its is something you will have every playthrough, it is always relevant. And pretty instrumental into roleplay.

The cultures system: changing the cultures to make your culture feel more how you want them to be OR what you need on paper, makes it a mainstay is every long playthrough. Before prestige was something u saved at the start of the game, until you hit a point where you are massing 5K, 8K, 10+k prestige and it seemed like a stupid resource. It makes sense that the king, the head of a culture could sway its folks into certain beliefs and directions if he had enough gravitas and importance. 
The royal court: The inventory is another really baseline mechanic, that intregrates the artifacts system from ck2 very well. You can get these in many manners. Now the royal court itself is personally a very nice addition:
As a player who is 50/50 roleplay tactics, i won't always be looking at it and i sometimes wished it was tuned to annoy you less during times of war. On the otherhand, you sometimes get impatient and want to blast 5X speed to get that amount of gold you need for a title, building, holding, etc... It creates a nice breather, that makes it feel a little more like a CK game.

So the thing is, in any other game this mechanic would be bs. It works for ck3.

I think personally the reviews are a little too harsh. See it like this:
CK3 unlike europe universalis, vic2, hoi4... is not a tactics grand strategy, it is not a resource management game.
Many of you will enjoy the game however, as a medieval military strategy game. And good for you!
I think if you see ck3 as it's supposed to be this DLC will be a no-brainer

[b]Should you buy it?[/b]
At full price, probably not. Wait for a sale, or ulterior, LEGAL methods that could save you quite the buck. 
But you definitely should, all in all. Reviews of base ck3 stated that there is so much to do in your first 200 years, but they die out quickly unless you enjoy map painting. This provides great progression for later in the game that doesn't break immersion or force you to step out of your box. It also provides some nice nuances to make you feel like you're actually playing a game about counts, princes and kings.",1645031735,1645031735,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198172690095",63,2,0,0,NA,0

I will not make a long review, basically cause there are plenty out there and most of them refer to the same issues: 

1. Limited content for what you paid (the culture re-work is great but is not such an important feature that it dramatically changes your previous CK3 experience, let alone the Royal Court and its -to say the least- modest visual and game-design new elements); and 
2. Ridiculously inflated price.

As I said, lots of bad reviews in this section. Hope the Dev and Publishing teams learn from this.",1645022771,1645022771,FALSE,4,0,"0.524095296859741211",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198044143919",167,2,0,0,NA,0

It adds a lot of subtle intricacies that really expand the role play and game play value of your campaign.  Its great to be able to see yourself on your throne actually interacting with your people.  It also adds an additional layer of things to do in the game and just brings the game to life a lot more. Now they just need to add many more varied event interactions to keep the ""meets and greets"" fresh and non-repetitive.

I can't help but feel that knowing what I know now after playing with Royal Court, if I did not have RC, I would still want it.  That's how much I am enjoying it (but then again, I didn't have to worry about price since my bf bought me it lol). I just feel that there are some DLC's in every game you just have to have.

The way cultures have been modeled is very realistic and nuanced, and I can see that a lot of work has been put into defining the cultures and how they interact with each other. In addition to cultures forming historical sub-groups, each culture has a ""cultural acceptance"" for every other other culture that varies by culture. You can convert (or cleanse, if you prefer) lands to your culture, but then the original culture will gradually start to hate you. Alternatively, you could increase the other culture's acceptance to your culture, and even end up creating a hybrid of the two cultures. 

The royal court and artifacts are good money sink for your gold and provide things to do in the mid game, while waiting for your culture to discover new things. I laughed my arse off when I hired a foreign artisan to design my throne and it ended up looking totally out of place.

All in all, this DLC is a must-have for CK3.

"449","110348896","110348896","dutch","The features of the DLC are quite fun. Making your own culture,  the dynasty banner and artefacts enhance the roleplaying aspect of the game. Paradox made a huge mistake valueing the price for the labour the employees did however. In no way possible can any reasonable customer value the price of the DLC €30 for the features that are delivered. The royal court DLC is fun, but the features are nowhere near justifiable for the price. It's literally 60% of the base game price with 5% of the base game's features. Think of the games you can buy with €30 on Steam and this price is outrageous. I have seen DLC worth €15 with 4 times as many features as this one. Even if you have plenty of money to spend I still don't recommend buying this DLC because it's frankly a grave insult to loyal fans. In fact, you can almost entirely ignore the royal court features (except maybe court grandeur) and be just fine during your playthrough.

"463","110331864","110331864","english","yeeeah honestly I'm enjoying it but moreso because of how it breaks everything
the dlc really doesn't add much, you could say the whole culture reformation and divergence thing should've been part of the free update because it makes more sense than for the dlc (but you have to sell, right? almost as if the main feature was kinda bland)

Speaking of which
the main feature of the dlc is honestly bland and uninteresting. The first time you get your courtroom you'll feel excited and hyped to see all the royal stuff you can do (keyword royal as dukes don't get courts, neither do tribals so good luck to those who expected a nice looking viking court) you can ""hold court"" once every 5 years and what that does is spawn random court events that can either help you or be mild annoyances (and also there's no penalty for never ever holding court so what's the point then??? lmao. Like seriously you get random court events whether or not you hold court so you're just saving 75 prestige by not doing it)

And the court amenities
it's hilariously easy to manage the upkeep, my court outshined the one from byzantium purely because I made more money monthly. And you want to prioritize monthly income because the bonuses you get from splendour are really good

Oh yeah, that's also a thing. You'll get random events that you won't actually read after the first time. Seriously they scripted like 20 and that's it (and it's the same no matter your culture or location as long as you're a feudal king) someone should count them
and the whole courtroom isn't varied at all you're locked to a default style according to your culture group so the only thing you can actually ""customize"" is whatever you want to show in your lil museum room which really isn't much, every slot is reserved for a specific kind of artifact

something really odd too sometimes the courtroom will tank all of your framerate and sometimes it'll run smoothly. I think you boys could've used a few more days to polish it

The artifacts thing is cool but also incredibly annoying, you wanna take a rare artifact? oh wait nevermind you didn't know such thing existed but you randomly got it in a single siege along 7 different low tier artifacts to the point that your inventory is scuffed with random stuff you found
random stuff that you can't destroy and the ""gift artifact option"" for some reason is restricted

And also, I've been messing with cultures like a madman to test the dlc to its full might and I'm a bit disappointed in the culture fusion feature
as for the reform culture yeah that one's the best. Anyway
they showed us examples of cultures that existed from fusions like the normans, the english and whatnot
but when you merge cultures in the game (which by the way can take you more than one lifetime if you don't have a good steward) rreally isn't that interesting

-you get innovations from both culutes (like if you're norse and you merge with greek you'll get a bunch of innovations for free)
-you get to pick the character naming, the styles of coat of arms (which is pointless because in ck3 EVERY COA looks the same aside from the inner designs)
-you get to pick the name and map colour 
-only a few counties will convert, yes you have to wait like 10 years per county which is a bummer (did I say wait? I meant promoting culture because counties never convert at will like they did in ck2. Awesome to preserve cultures in your realm, but terrible if you wanna have an efficient demense because you get reduced taxes from wrong cultures)
But when you do fuse, very little changes. You might be tinking ""AWESOME I CAN CUSTOMIZE MY COA AND MY KINGDOM'S COA with the little soldier displaying how your troops will look like. And then, when you do create your own new culture you can't customize much of it, only the map display and name (which by the way can only be set ONCE, so if you don't like the colour there's nothing you can do about it). The naming feature is weird, as I mentioned earlier you have to choose either one or both

So you can have characters named Björn or Nikomenos in a same family, which is a bit funny, it'd be cool to set our own like ""default list"" of names like culture groups instead of getting forced into those 2 you have
oh by the way, speaking of either one of those, the lil soldiers you see on your map? you can only choose 1 style, and that's permanent, for example either norse or greek. You can't customise that one like at all


Tl:dr?
The main feature is really bland, sorry paradox I know you missed on december to polish this as much as you could but you really didn't make that one feature that interesting
The culture features that I'm betting were stripped from the free update to the dlc are kinda worth it
gives it a lot of roleplay value (lacking some customisation but still about enough, there are unique culture names you can create like Burgundian, Austrian, Rhinelander, etc. I did a run as burgundy and that one felt really nice)
Worth buying?
Yeah you might want to wait for a discount on this one, it's good to have sure
but for that price it's a no-no
specially since its main feature doesn't hit the spot

Crusader Kings III: 

Royal Court[/h1]

""Crusader Kings III"" ist eine typische Paradox Grand-Strategy-Simulation.

CKIII deckt den Zeitraum von 867 bis 1453 ab, der Vernichtung Byzanz, dem Fall Konstantinopels der das Ende des europäischen Mittelalters markiert. Als Startpunkt kann man neben 867 auch 1066 wählen, das Jahr der berühmten Schlacht bei Hastings, in der Wilhelm der Eroberer den Grundstein für die normannische Herrschaft über England legte und damit das gesamte europäische Gefüge neu austarierte. Aber spielen können wir nicht nur als europäische Großmacht. Die Karte schließt im Osten Indien und die Steppenvölker ein, reicht bis an die Grenze des chinesischen Reiches. Im Süden reicht die über das Horn von Afrika hinaus bis zum (auch spielbaren) Mogadischu. 

Und spielen können wir jeden Herrscher (ab der Größe eines Grafen). Ob als ghanaischer König, als indischer Maharadscha, als Graf von Augsburg oder als uplandischer Jarl. Lediglich Theokratien und Republiken sind (noch) nicht spielbar.

Paradox deckt mit seinen historischen Titeln jeweils eine bestimmte Epoche ab. Die herausragende Qualität von diesen Paradox-Titeln liegt in der Erkenntnis, daß jede Epoche eigener Mechaniken bedarf, für jede Epoche eigene politische Agenden wichtig waren, Mentalitäten und gesellschaftliche Strukturen in der Geschichte grundverschieden waren. Damit begreift Paradox Diskurse, die etwa durch Michel Foucault (""Die Ordnung der Dinge"") wesentlich befeuert wurden. Er geht (vereinfacht beschrieben) davon aus, daß jede Epoche einen Zentralpunkt des Denkens hatte. War es im Mittelalter etwa die Religion, tritt in der Neuzeit der Mensch als Individuum in den Fokus. Aus diesem Zentralpunkt ergeben sich dann als Ausfluß wesentliche gesellschaftliche, kulturelle und politische Strukturen.

Dieses Prinzip hat Paradox schon seit ihren ersten Titeln begriffen und inkanalisiert, was sie auch wesentlich von anderen Entwicklern unterscheidet, die diese strukturelle Denkleistung nicht vollzogen haben. 

Mittelalter. Das wichtigste hier: die Dynastie und die Religion. Das Konzept der großen Nationalstaaten existiert noch nicht. Kaiser und Könige besitzen nicht das ganze Land über das sie herrschen, sondern haben stets begrenzte Macht über ihr Vasallen. Und so können wir denn auch immer nur eine begrenzte Anzahl an Provinzen selbst besitzen. Kommen wir über das Limit, müssen wir empfindliche Mali ertragen. Also geben wir eroberte Provinzen lieber an andere Charaktere, an unseren Sohn zum Beispiel und stellen so sicher, daß die Provinz erstmal in der Machtsphäre unserer Dynastie bleibt. 

Jeder Charakter hat eine Reihe von Werten wie Diplomatie oder Verwaltung und eine Reihe von Eigenschaften, Tugenden und Sünden. Hinzu kommt ein neues Schwerpunktsystem, in dem wir uns auf einen Fokusbaum konzentrieren können und unseren Charakter, der stets schon mit erblichen Dispositionen ausgestattet ist, so in eine bestimmte Richtung entwickeln können. 

Überhaupt ist die Charakterentwicklung, das rollenspielerische, relevanter und umfänglicher geworden. Zentrale Charaktereigenschaften sind durch den Avatar direkt sichtbar. Stolze Charaktere etwa tragen die Nase hoch, unmäßige neigen zu Fettleibigkeit.

Zentral wichtig ist auch nach wie vor der Kampf und die Diplomatie. Bündnisse werden durch Heiratspolitik geschmiedet. Stehende Heere gibt es noch nicht, sondern alle Truppen müssen erst ausgehoben werden. Sehr gut ist das neue System der Ritter, relevanter Einzelkämpfer und der Einheiten wie Pikeniere oder Bogenschützen, die wir zu den üblichen Bauerntruppen rekrutieren können. 

Überhaupt wurde vieles entschlackt, einiges auch vereinfacht und übersichtlicher gemacht. CKIII konzentriert sich auf wesentliche Mechaniken, wie Krieg oder Intrigen, streicht aber auch einige Mechaniken des Vorgängers. Insgesamt tut das der Reihe aber gut, denn alles ist konsequenter, fokussierter und logischer geworden. Die an einigen Ecken noch vermißte Komplexität wird sicher paradoxüblich über die Jahre noch reichlich ausgebaut werden. 

Viele Mechaniken könnte man noch beschreiben. Die Vermächtnisse etwa, die unseren Dynastiesprößlingen schon bei Geburt einen Bonus geben oder das neue System der Druckmittel, mit dem wir andere Charaktere beeinflussen, uns aber auch selber in der Hand eines Anderen wiederfinden können. Auch die vervielfältigten Religionen und die Möglichkeit selber eine Religion zu gründen, sind überzeugend. Es fehlen aber Systeme des Vorgängers wie Artefakte oder auch das System der Seuchen. Auch der Ausbau der Provinzen ist eher simpel gehalten.

Bei allem Detailkram sei nun aber mal deutlich gesagt: CKIII ist großartig. Noch ist es eine fokussierte Basis, die schon verdammt viel Spaß macht, überzeugend funktioniert und sich als ein wunderbarer endloser Geschichtengenerator erweist. Die Geburt ist mehr als gelungen. Die angelegten Strukturen sind besser denn je, die Bedienbarkeit weitaus übersichtlicher geworden. Bugs gibt es nur wenige irrelevante. Und wenn auch das Kind noch Erfahrung braucht, sich noch entwickeln muß, der Sprößling ist jetzt schon ein Genie. 

Anders gesagt: CKIII ist zum Niederknien überzeugend gut geworden und wird sich im Laufe seiner Entwicklung ohne Frage zum besten Grand-Strategy-Spiel aller Zeiten mausern. 

Ein Meisterstück. 

Das DLC ""Royal Court"" kommt - paradoxüblich - zusammen mit einem riesigen Patch, der neue Spielmechaniken einführt, die durch das DLC noch ausdifferenzierter beeinflußbar werden. 

Zentral scheint der erstmals dreidimensional dargestellte Hof, in dem sich alle wichtigen Mitglieder des eigenen Hofes wiederfinden, in dem man Artefakte, Banner und Möbel ausstellen kann, seine Hofsprache und Hofart festlegen kann und in dem es Ereignisse geben kann, die unsere Entscheidung verlangen. Allerdings ist der Hof nur für Könige und Kaiser verfügbar. Interessant ist die Hofpracht, die mindestens einem Erwartungswert entsprechen sollte, um diverse Boni abzugreifen. Bei vier Hofannehmnlichkeiten - Mode, Verpflegung, Unterbringung und Dienerschaft - können wir entscheiden, wieviel Geld es uns Wert ist, die Hofpracht zu steigern. 

So interessant und optisch primär der Hof auf den ersten Blick wirkt, für mich ist er nicht der einzig relevante Teil des DLCs. So oft wird man die 3D-Ansicht auch gar nicht nutzen. Zudem merkt man, daß Paradox hier ein Modul einführt, das noch einigen Raum für Erweiterung und Ausdifferenzierung bietet. 

Fast wichtiger scheinen mir die neuen kulturellen und mechanischen Möglichkeiten, die uns auch in niedrigeren Rängen zur Verfügung stehen. Es gibt einige neue Hofämter, die zu besetzen sind. Der Erzzeugwart kann persönliche Artefakte zu Hofartefakten umschmieden. Als Vasall können wir unserem König huldigen oder eine Petition an ihn richten.

Wir haben deutlich mehr Einflußmöglichkeiten auf unsere Kultur. Als Kulturoberhaupt können wir Traditionen wechseln. Wir können auch eine neue Kultur entwickeln, indem wir uns von unserer bisherigen Kultur abspalten. Wir können auch neue Mischkulturen bilden und so die sinnvollsten Vorteile zweier Kulturen verschmelzen. Auch ein neues Vermächtnis, das sich auf den Spracherwerb bezieht, kommt hinzu.

Der DLC bietet einen netten 3D-Hof, er bietet aber vor allem eine große Menge an neuen Mechaniken, die vor allem für den Roleplay-Aspekt des Spieles eine Fundgrube für neue Geschichten bietet. Dadurch entwickelt das DLC den zentralen und wesentlichen Bestandteil von Crusader Kings, nämlich den historischen Story-Generator, sinnvoll und facettenreich weiter und vertieft dadurch das Hauptspiel.

Noch immer ist Crusader Kings III weit davon entfernt, die ihm mögliche Komplexität auszuschöpfen, aber die Schritte auf dem Weg dorthin sind deutlich und bestimmt. Immerhin hat der Vorgänger auch zehn Jahre Entwicklung genossen, bis er zu dem bekannten Komplexitätsmonster mutiert ist

"495","110306771","110306771","english","I do have to preface this by saying that, as I bought the royal edition, I got the DLC at the same time as the free update so what is part of what is a bit murky for me.
That being said, this is a real game-changer. 
Sure, most of the content of the DLC is only relevant if you are playing as a king or an emperor, the culture aspects can be relevant otherwise especially if you are set somewhere between two cultures or conquer a different culture (for instance, through a Varangian adventure). For the characters the DLC is relevant to, however, this Expansion really makes the game come alive. 
Before this expansion I still had the feeling, much like I did (and still sorta do) with Imperator, that CK3 was still not a full game. Sure, it was fun, but a bit lackluster, especially when compared to CK2. And CK2 also has the problem that your court really doesn't mean much. Even with the council having to approve your actions, it was more of a game of making opinion numbers go up to be able to do stuff (and sometimes killing some vassals whose numbers refused to go up ;). 
This expansion solves both issues. The entire culture mechanic makes for truly interesting gameplay, havint to choose whether it's worth it to hybridize a culture to make your realm more manageable but making conquest of your old culture a bit harder, choosing whether or not to conquer somewhere with a different culture that is going to be a hassle to manage, and so on. It makes me excited to see if they do a religion revamp, as a similar possibility of religion syncretism (as historically happened, for instance, between Muslims and Hindus in northern India) could make the game more interesting in that aspect too. In regard to the court itself, and the artifacts, people are very right to point out the lack of visual changes. The court does change it's look when changing grandeur levels, but the changes are so subtle they can easily go unnoticed. However, I don't exactly play paradox titles for the looks, but for the game, and the court events and artifacts are very good at telling a story and making gameplay more varied. It is very interesting, for example, when you pay someone to make you a sword and your wife, who knows nothing about fighting, decides she want's to give an opinion on how it's made, and you have to choose between making her sad or getting a worse sword. The court positions are, for me, the star of the Expansion. The fact that the courtier's abilities are relevant to their position and that they truly change the game, be it by giving you bonuses or by allowing you different decisions, really stands out against CK2's court positions that merely made people happier. And courtiers may get mad if you give a position to someone they consider less important, which makes juggling expectations something that you actually have to do.
Overall, this Expansion is worth it. It is a bit expensive, and maybe it should have been part of the base game, but I do think it is a great expansion and a step in the right direction to make CK3 really stand out among paradox titles and grand strategy games in general.",1644946267,1644946267,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198080412754",560,4,0,0,NA,0

To begin, the crashes. I had over 300 hours in CK3 before this DLC came out and I had only had it crash on me once. Since the new update and DLC, the game only starts up properly about a third to a half of the time on first try. Not only that, but I have had 3 crashes while playing for seemingly no reason, which is extremely frustrating when the game takes like 15 minutes to load up again. Related to this is the hardware-intensiveness of the actual Royal Court. Now, my computer isn't anything crazy, but it is a good computer and doesn't have any problems running CK3 normally.

The graphics are very basic, to the point that they didn't implement a free camera to avoid the players looking in details at how bad it is, and they also introduced a new bug, making every portrait look awful. This is something immediately noticeable as soon as you start the game and it's especially annoying considering it was added in a DLC focused on graphics. This is only the tip of the iceberg as the game is riddled with bugs since the DLC was released, and a week later there is still no hotfix including for the major ones and very little communication on this.

The best addition are the Cultural mechanics that open up new gameplay opportunities.
Being able to hybridize cultures, learn new languages and boost cultural acceptance are useful tools in resolving problems without resorting to domination.

The artifact system is pretty good and can provide substantial buffs (the prowess ones are over-powered)

The 3d court aspect needs more work / content. Currently the court doesn't feel much more lavish regardless of how much you put into. 

Overall this adds enough to the game to warrant the price, even if the 3d content is sparse.

Wem das zu viel für Unterhaltung ist dem ist auch anderweitig nicht zu helfen. Denn auch die Angestellten der Entwickler und Publisher wollen mehr als Mindestlohn verdienen.

Diese ich will alles für so wenig wie möglich Mentalität funktioniert nicht.  
Ob es jetzt die 30 Euro Wert ist muss jeder für sich selbst entscheiden.

2.) Ich wundere mich nur darüber, dass bei einem Produkt wie einem Bildschirm oder eine Grafikkarte die Menschen auch nicht  nach UVP oder dem ersten Ladenpreis kaufen, sondern verschiedene Läden vergleichen und auf Angebote warten.

Das funktioniert auch mit Spielen. Nur mal so am Rande.",1644922337,1644922358,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197985235454",97,12,0,0,NA,0

Royal Court -->sadly not really anything worth mentioning as it is. Interactions are quite few and repetitve. In the end its all bout keeping your Grandeur Level up, which might appear as a pain in the ass for quickly rising empires, but after some time it basically runs itself 
The literally only thing of that entire DLC that will effect you till possibly the end of your game are the ridiculous Court Amenities which take around 50-75% of your income ->so far i havent really found a way to avoid those entirely
Cultural changes -->  Languages are quite fun and helps with the integration of neighbeouring rulers into ur realms (but tbh before the DLC you would ve just taken em by force anyway) and the Perk system add some interesting Perks, but in the end are mostly just some recycled Dynasty/Religion Perks
Artefact System --> is quite fun and is the only addition which doesnt feel like a complete waste of your hardearned gold (hope they gonna add some more different graphics though to make your court feel a bit more unique. The only thing i totally hate about it is the ""Demand Artefact""-Feature....maybe changing it into ""Asking for Artefact"" would make more sense cause i mean WTF how can a lowly Count make demands of an emperor ?1?!

"541","110273295","110273295","english","Here's a basic summary of everything the DLC adds:

Dynamic Cultures: Adds tiny stat changes and opinion modifiers you can basically ignore. Changing or customizing cultures is basically only relevant very late game when you have nothing better to use your prestige on. 

Visually Modeled Courts: Watch a series of bland static images play out in a court room that looks functionally identical to every other court around you regardless of your wealth or power. You can't customize anything substantial, it adds nothing visually to the events other than the occasional character model standing motionless in front of you, and you'll basically just ignore the screen until you're forced to interact with a random popup event. Want to watch feasts, weddings, assassination attempts, executions, coronations, and more? Well maybe one day you can spend another $30 to see those things, for now you're out of luck.

New Events: Every new event pretty much comes down to a single choice between a few options where you just pick the one with the best chance of randomly landing on a good result. Watch as you're forced to make countless inconsequential dice rolls that usually just affect your popularity in a random county or make a certain mayor you didn't know existed slightly mad at you, and basically nothing else.

Artifacts: Constantly accrue more minor stat changes attached to copy-and-paste junk that is tedious to get rid of. Only a few of the historic / legendary artifacts offer any kind of interesting bonuses, but getting them is purely random chance. There also seems to be a grand total of 5 different artifact models in the game to show off. Who knew the Iron Crown of the Lombards looked exactly the same as the cheap copper one I paid a random metal smith to make for 20 bucks?

Grandeur: What could be more dynamic and fun than constantly pay some of your gold income for more minor stat changes? Yup, that's pretty much all it is. 

Overall, the Royal Court experience was bland, uninspired, and left the gameplay feeling essentially unchanged. Even if you're a hardcore fan of CK (like I am), I would still avoid buying this DLC for anything more than about 5 bucks, certainly not for 30.",1644904947,1644904947,FALSE,82,0,"0.841664791107177734",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198043850572",47,2,0,0,NA,0

CK3 desperately needed this. The artifact system is pretty good, and the prowess modifiers are great, since you didn't really have any unless you had a blademaster, hunter, or strength trait(s). All the bonuses to renown are great since it was really hard to come by unless you had high intrigue, lots of kids, and willingness to micromanage to get your descendants on other thrones. But the best part is by far the cultures. The first time I made a new religion, I thought, ""wait, can I make a new culture too?"" I was disappointed when I found that I couldn't, but when this was announced, I cheered out loud. The customizability is amazing. When mod makers start to get in on this in full, [i] evil laugh [/i] the things they'll do! I can't wait. 

[h1] The Bad [/h1]

The Royal court/court languages give more immersion, they have little effect on gameplay, and when they do, it feels forced. It sometimes becomes unavoidable that someone important loses opinion of you, and you're assassinated or that one vassal not yet in a faction joins one and you lose the throne, along with that fancy throne room that cost you the throne in the first place. The expansion is also overpriced (I did preorder though, sooooo...). Wait for a half price sale, or for paradox to drop the price. Wait...

[h1] The Potential [/h1]

Each culture has at least 3 traditions, with each tradition adding more flavour and potential for roleplay. The genius of this system comes from it's modularity. New traditions can be added or swapped in for a cost of prestige. The cost is reduced if you fulfil certain requirements e.g having 5 cynical counts of your culture reduces the cost for ""Life is just a joke"". This system discourages minmaxing (somewhat) and encourages you to choose traditions which make sense for the story you are creating. However, these changes take time to implement, thus you can diverge your culture, allowing you to swap out any of your traditions (costs applied) immediately. This adds massive storytelling potential e.g An independent Epirus may diverge from their Byzantine forebears, or may diverge even as a vassal.
If 2 cultures have high enough acceptance (usually 40%), they can hybridise, taking a mix of the traditions and pillars of the parent cultures to form something wholly unique. Finally, I can merge Irish and Italian cultures to create potato-based pasta (that's just gnocchi but you get the idea). 
And yes, the AI does utilise these features. I've seen some interesting creations such as Greco-Bulgarian or the monstrous Croato-Carato-Franconian. Thankfully, how frequent the AI diverges and hybridises is at the player's discretion, in case you wish to prevent the emergence of Afgan-Polish-Franco-Afgan-Albanian.
Whilst the overhaul of culture is part of the free patch alongside the update, hybridising and diverging culture are DLC features.

Next, there is the artifact system, which is executed more elegantly than in CK2. You can commission specific artifacts, or loot them from others but the main method of acquisition is by sponsoring guests' inspirations. Whilst this can get frustrating if you are after a specific type of artifact, it does add a sense of excitement to the system- there is no surefire way to know what exactly you are about to receive. There is a system for artifact claims, but unless you are in the habit of getting raided, nasty succession, or borderline exploits, they don't factor much into gameplay.
Whilst the system adds great potential to storytelling as a battle-winning axe becomes a treasured heirloom, I found I was often swamped by a deluge of low-quality artifacts, mainly attained from sieges or random inheritance. The constant supply of trash made it difficult to navigate through menu's to see the artifacts that mattered. My Queen's prized dagger was buried beneath a pile of more, identical and worthless ones. I wish there was a mechanic for artifact quality to improve as certain weapons or pieces of armour become instrumental in the history of the Polish-French people, Except there is a system for that, kind of, Your dynasty banner gets upgraded as you gain more renown, and some artifacts gain extra effects or flavour text over time. Unfortunately, without a straight increase from Fine to Masterwork level, this difference is hard to spot at a glance. There is also no convenient way to get rid of artifacts- there is a reason that a popular mod lets you auction them off. The system is definitely an improvement over CK2's but it just needs to go a bit further to be truly great.

Finally, the titular Royal Court system is a great addition to the game. It feels great to fill my courtroom with rare artifacts, although I feel that there aren't enough slots for all of my most prized possessions- perhaps a slightly larger court for emperors would work best? Holding court is a great bit of roleplay, along with the court events. However, these events begin to feel a bit repetitive, and a few dozen more of them would  be much appreciated.
Many in the community feel that the restriction of courts to Kings and Emperors is unfair and that dukes should also have access to this new feature. Whilst I understand the frustration, the restriction is most likely down to performance- there are far more dukes than kings and emperors, thus if each duke owned a royal court, there could be significant slowdown. The best solution would be an option to enable duke courts for beefier systems, although I am fine without duke courts for now.

Despite the high price, I do feel that Royal Court is worth buying due to the new depth in roleplay and a massive increase in options for storytelling. Not every addition is perfect (the language system is so minor I forgot to mention it in this review), but the breadth of new narratives to create is worth the asking price. If you just aren't into roleplay in grand strategy games, then this DLC may not be for you.",1644871842,1644871842,TRUE,1,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198810851282",434,24,0,0,NA,0

"583","110248555","110248555","english","TL:DR: Wait for a sale if you really want it. $30 and over a year of development with barely anything to show for it. Most of the important stuff you will get with the free update anyway. 

The majority of the paid content is gated by only being available to non-tribal Kings and Emperors. The 3D courtroom is ugly, a glorified diorama since you can't move around it freely. Also, there's only 4 variations of the courtroom, so there will be a lot of unimmersive overlap. Court decisions are extremely repetitive, and they don't impact your game as much as you'd want to; aside from a couple that I won't spoil here. Artifacts are busted and op, they make the game even easier than it was before.

Culture overhaul is AMAZING, though not really part of the paid content since that comes up with the free patch. You pay to be able to diverge, hybridize and reform your culture. Which is pretty cool, to be fair. This allows the player to forge their own distinct culture from the rest. 

In the end, if you paid, half of this DLC is severely lacking, and the other half OK. Both of these do not add up to $30. So I can't really recommend this outside of 50%+ discounted sales.

Introduces a culture pack, changes Daju (Darfur / Whats Left of Egypt) culture to female only inheritance. Leaves religion male dominant. Now only my daughters can inherit but I can't give them titles. Sick move mixing gender laws into two different aspects of the game that aren't tied to each other and can cancel each other out, who could have foreseen the consequences? Additionally there is ABSOLUTELY NO historical context for this. There would be more historical context adding this to the vikings than here, and on top of that you made an unplayable game state. 

Look I get you want to make fantasy experiences happen at the fringe civilizations of the game but maybe make it mechanically functional. There are already options to change gender laws in the settings. Either change it back or remove the religious setting that overrides the cultural one.

This is why you have bugs Paradox. The second you think of something new you throw out all design principles and slap it in place.

This expansion is absolutely not worth 30 dollars. ""Glad"" I got it for the price of pre-order but unless this is on sale for 10 bucks it adds barely anything more than the previous 6.99 Nazi fantasy flavor pack DLC targeting the 3 wolves howling at the moon audience at full price. This broken minor tweak only experienced at the kingdom level or above (save for the bugs which trickle down into the other levels) is sure to add some functionality for modders to play with so that they can make the game Paradox can't. 

I'm sure it will be polished 6 months from now, I'll check it out then.

This DLC doesn't fundamentally change anything about the game enough to make it worth replaying and breaks if you're not playing a kingdom in a heavily played cultural area.

    [*] There are no new armor options. A few pieces of chainmail, etc would have been nice to complement crafting.
    [*] Managing the court is reduced to four sliders.

The actual Royal Court feature, which the DLC is named for, is novel but disappointing. It's all optional, so you don't have to hold court or engage with the mechanics, which is kind of a plus because after a few hours they're already kind of tedious (Plus the court itself doesn't look good with the lighting being all washed out and uber-bright, not to mention characters' eyes and stiff poses. I'd rather it be dark and realistic looking so I didn't have to see how awkward everyone looks). 

It's not all bad - artifacts and court artifacts are a welcome addition as something that felt missing when CK3 released. 

Court events seem a bit skewed to the point that holding court is straight up dangerous; my half-brother and friend who was imprisoned by another king showed up at court and tried to murder me despite being imprisoned and having +80 opinion. Another time a random mayor who wasn't in any factions drew a knife and disfigured me, my wife, and my seneschal for unknown reasons (Opinion +10). Alrighty then.

It's also not very multiplayer friendly, as you're either rushing to click through as fast as you can or you're sighing as your friend takes too long to finish and unpause. It's definitely an improvement over the base game, that's for sure, but $30 is far too ambitious of a price tag.

TBH, in my opinion, problem of this DLC is mostly that main game was made exceptionally appealing to broad community of players, but THIS DLC looks like it was exclusively focused on old CK fans. Culture changes was a wet dream of a lot of ck2 players for forever, and ck3 got it in FIRST DLC. As well as expanded artifact system, but I wish it actually added more actual progression. Court building (or what is it?) should be a buildable and expandable entity, accessible from any rank and to any government, limiting you only with how much it costs. Language things are too much micro, court titles are a lot of micro too. That's what OLD CK fans would be more tolerant to, but not the broad community that ck3 managed to gather. Devs managed to get to the next level of accessibility with main game, but failed to do so with an expansion.

Then, 1.5 years later, the first major expansion is a glorified event generator which gets repetitive fast and makes you feel more like a talk show host than a medieval ruler, since you get to hold court about infidelity, lack of personal hygiene, farts and such kind of meme-like nonsense. Also, why waste so much time and resources to create it in 3D while it basically gives the same results of normal events? It's pointless and the visuals are mediocre at best.
The artifacts aren't bad per se, but they lead to the same kind of power creep that Jade Dragon introduced in the final years of CK2, making the game easier and easier while the dynasty gradually piles up items. Giving it high priority imho isn't a good sign.
The new culture system is probably the best mechanic of the dlc, but imho atm there is little reason to stay committed to a campaign long enough to really make it shine.

TL;DR: overhyped and vastly overpriced but underwhelming.

Hope the devs will ramp up the porting of CK2 mechanics and events to give CK3 the much needed variety instead of going down the The Sims road, otherwise this will be the last dlc I'll buy for a long, long time.

A few things I noticed:
1. The gear that you equip does not change your visuals at all - it is just another stat for your character. This is quite a shame for a game that has 3D characters that change clothes based on culture or rank. If you are a king, you have a crown displayed even though you have no crown. This is a bit stupid.
2. The royal courts are fairly similar - apart from the cultural differences. My own royal court didn't change all that much from when I got my first king to my last emporer. It was the same glorified shed I started with as king.
3. Over the course of a normal ironman game I got so much gear that it felt like I had too much gear. The good gear, is not THAT much better than the bad gear. If I lost some gear, I certainly wouldn't start a war to get it back.
4. I noticed a bug or two, that I dont know if it's just part of the base game. I asked for a divorce, paid the piety cost, the pope accepted it... but I am still married and got no popup or anything explaining why.

"638","110215717","110215717","english","So this DLC is definitely going to be more for the roleplayers out there, and leans far more heavily into that than most of the DLCs from the previous game.

The major features are the Royal Court, the events associated with holding court for your vassals, the titles, and the court artifacts, then theres the culture overhaul. The former adds a lot of flavor to the game and more to do if you're into acting out more the whole being a ruler aspect. The artifacts are also a nice addition, being able to forge that crown that your dynasty passes down for generations. Then the culture is an amazing change that definitely adds more to the realism aspect. Now if you're a viking that conquers India you no longer have to simply become the local culture or create a random Nordic area surrounded by completely unreleated cultures, you can now combine the two and become Indian vikings. Live out various what if scenarios, what if the Pechenegs decided to settle down in Georgia and merge with the local peoples, what if French nobles slowly integrated with the local culture in Flanders forming a new distinct identity, do as you wish.

The issue with this DLC is that these features aren't game changing to the actual mechanics of the game, as even though the culture mechanics are completely revamped they're not really something you're going to be interacting with more than a handful of times throughout the game. For the people that simply play these types of games to paint the biggest empire of the map you're not going to get anything out of this pack, and unless you just really want these features I'd honestly wait on a sale since $30.00 is definitely a bit much for whats provided.

 I like the direction they're taking with the DLCs for CK3, leaning more into adding more to the flavor of the game and giving more to do as we live our royal in game lives rather than doing a major war overhaul for example.

It is obvious from a game design perspective why ducal courts and below are not implemented, and while it would have been nice, considering the amount of actors in the game it would have been madness. Besides, being a King is a real goal now ! And goals, this DLC gives you plenty : get a beast economy to pay for your massive royal spending, dress up your court nice ; find those forgotten daughters of your dynasty who were buried in the menus now hanging in front of  your throne (and all the other characters for tha matter ) ! 

That last part is the massive game changer for me. The court. It's not cosmetic. So many fantastic opportunities I found out about, just by seeing who is who today !  And the artefacts too are a game changers. Aristocracy as it's core is about spending money on luxury items instead of infrastructure development. Before you could only spend money on the growth of the kingdom ( lol ) now it's all about who has the most treasures. I won't call them trinkets, because they are powerful items in their own rights, even those you don't use are a potent gift, and those in you inventory can be re-purposed for your throne room ! 

Culture changes are excellent, a fantastic prestige sink. Some religious tenets were turned into culture, meaning less hard choices to create the socio-religious build of your dreams !

I will say this, if you do not enjoy this expansion, I am sorry to say you don't play the game right. I get some feel the game needs more events to feel complete, but the system, the opportunities, the family drama is already there.

I did not pay for a single episode of Game of Thrones. But 30 euros for this ? Take my money and make more content with it. My campaign is sure to have a more fulfilling ending anyway.",1644827557,1644827557,TRUE,2,0,"0.476003140211105347",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198177538511",21,6,0,0,NA,0

The culture update is a good addition and pdx should continue to work on improving game systems like this.
The rest is rather undercooked and forgettable in the current state.
The Court system sounded like a great idea but has far to little actual impact on what you do in your day-to-day business and is in not tied into the game enough, it feels they made it 3D to be able to justify the price of this dlc but it looks rather boring, like most of the connected events, it is a good idea but the implementation is lackluster.

Overall I expected a more in-depth update after such a long hiatus, especially for this price.",1644823857,1644823857,FALSE,1,0,"0.500846028327941895",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197960395377",414,9,0,0,NA,0

This is a niche genre, and paradox gives us more content than any AAA developer over the course of a games lifetime.

I get hundreds of hours out of these games… consider a sports game player pays 70-100 dollars every year, is slammed with micro transactions, and then does it again the next year for essentially the same game… and this is just one example.

- The so called ""Royal Court"" which was over hyped by the devs to the extreme. 
   > Rather mediocre character models 
   > Reused animations from the base game 
   > Some of the weirdest and frankly annoying court events that frequently produce more negative effects than positive. I 
   mean they have a court event for leaky latrines but not like a wedding event or a real feast event to see any of the court 
   amenities you shell out gold for.
   > The aforementioned court amenities; Fashion which never visually changes, Food, Servants, and Rooms. 
   > Oh and you have to be at least a king and either feudal or clan to even have any of this so if you're a count, duke, or tribal too bad you don't even have access to any of the previously mentioned things.
   > There's also a court splendor level which doesn't have any visual changes, only stat changes. 
   > Only a handful of court types with little variation for different regions, cultures, religions, etc 

- The artifacts system from CK2 makes it's return and it's a mixed bag. The court artifacts are pretty interesting but are very poorly placed in the court that makes your court look more like a history museum exhibit than an actual noble court. The personal artifacts however are pretty much just glorified stat modifiers. None with the exception of your weapon are visible and even that is only visible in duels.

- And finally the culture overhaul which expands cultures a bit and does make them a bit more interesting but not enough to be game changers like the devs claim. The divergence and hybridization features are cool and allow for interesting combos but once again nothing game changing considering the asking price

In review the devs seem to think that just because it took them 18 months to figure out how to code the royal court visuals (which are rather mediocre mind you) somehow justifies charging over half of the price of the base game for a what is essentially a few gimmicks and no substantial content that will open up more interesting scenarios or change the way you approach a playthrough. This especially when compared to the Northern Lords culture pack that made playing the vikings so much more interesting and added new and meaningful features all for a $7 price tag. They really hyped this dlc up, treated it like it was a Far East expansion (now that I would pay $30 for), and took a year and a half of dev time all for something that I would barely justify paying $10 for let alone $30.

"667","110200635","110200635","english","I was surprised to find all the negative reviews. Months of devblogs illustrated in great detail exactly what would be added in this expansion pack. There were no surprises here. 

For me, it added a good amount of day to day king activities to help fill the time between wars and succession crises. The throne room is actually really cool and the character models themselves have improved a lot alongside it. The bonuses are great including some pretty powerful perks and even new councillor tasks. Plus, I just like poking my head into it to see who is mulling around and sometimes meeting new people or commissioning new inspirations. Getting to look at other people's courts is nice too, as I can immediately see who's who, which helps me plan my intrigue ops. Overall, it feels like a big gap in game play was filled by this expansion and it executes on its vision and promise flawlessly. I also found the new culture system to be more impactful than I expected. The bonuses are pretty good, and it isn't hard to add new ones. I have enjoyed modeling my culture around the particulars of its place and time in history. 

My primary nitpick is that Dukes are not allowed to have courts. Some of the most famous courts in history belonged to duchies and it seems like some sort of allowance could have been made in this mechanic for Dukes. I enjoy playing at the lower ranks, but now I am missing out on most of what this expansion has to offer if I do. Even a more limited version of the throne room would still be fun. 

I got it as part of the pre-order deal, and I agree that it could be cheaper, but I would still pay $30 for it and not feel cheated.

I mean, 3D throne room is a good idea for immersion, and culture and court language also help for immersion as well.

But there are a lot of places that could have been filled in prior to the spots Royal Court touched on. More bookmarked start dates (beyond, you know, 867 and 1066) would have been a good initial addition that doesn't happen here. Further, law-setting and more tools for running your fiefdom would have been great... this DLC *kinda* adds a bit of that with some of the cultural stuff, but basic government options are missing. Prior to having high crown authority, it would really help if there were more tools to keep rivals and factions in-line rather than so often resorting to intrigue. 

Which gets me to maybe the most egregious problem with Royal Court: it adds so little to the start of a new game. You don't even get the court until you achieve a high enough rank, so duchies and counties play pretty much the same as always. Byzantines and a couple others do get a lot right away (the court, but also a few artifacts already). But a lot of the fun of CK as a series has always been playing it the opposite of how I'd play EU-IV: in CK, I want to start small and really grow, meaning that I don't want to play the majors as often. 

I wish there was a numerical score or some other format on offer for Steam reviews sometimes, because this is probably a 4.5 to 5.0 out of 10... simply giving it a thumbs down obscures the fact that some of what RC adds is relatively good.

However, it's way overpriced and potentially somewhat useless to many players, including me. I like to play a lot of games as tribal power, and they don't get a tribal court, so this DLC is basically pointless in those games. I also like to start out as a Duke and, since only kings get a royal court, this DLC is again somewhat pointless for me. 

I did try out a game as a king so I could comment with some experience on the actual features, and some of it was definitely fun. It does get old fast, and once you have large court, you will have piles of pointless artifacts. I'm glad they added these features, but it definitely hasn't been a game changer for me.

For a $30 DLC, I'm pretty disappointed they didn't give tribal governments some type of royal court. If I bought this as a standalone purchase and not part of the Royal Edition, I'd be extra annoyed. A quick browse of the Steam top selling games highlights that $30 can buy some pretty amazing full games.

No wonder they didn't allow free roam camera, as you might have noticed the glaring issues such as everyone squinting like a Japanse (did they even bother playing the game?)

One of the main selling points  is having character items like swords and armour. Yet these have the most generic designs imaginable - a sword is just a 2d image which you can't do anything with by the way. It would be too much to ask for a dlc that's based around the idea of displaying stuff in 3d to show you the ""rare"" armour you're wearing! Same with artefacts which you can't see in your court (most are just boxes) 

The entire DLC is essentially just an amalgamation of different modifiers that you could easily go through the entire play through without even noticing; that's how inconsequential they are.

Finally you have the most grandiose court in the world, with top notch fashion and food? I doubt you'll notice it as the court looks exactly the same no matter how much you invest in it!

"712","110171378","110171378","english","Overall, I enjoy this expansion, I still tend to play CK2 over CK3. I think people complaining seem to be mostly people who don't like the price, which I am not going to get into. Others don't think it adds anything, and I think this is more the people that play this as purely a grand strategy and don't get into the story telling and characters in the game. The main things it adds are culture changes, the royal court/holding court, and artifact crafting and displaying/equipping. 

1 - The cultural changes. I think these are good, but can be better. I love the idea that you can merge cultures to create custom cultures from the two. I am now paying attention to my culture and actually trying to create and merge cultures to make my culture stronger. I used to just stick with the culture I started with for the entire game. I still don't love the cultural research aspect of it, but that hasn't really changed

2 - The royal court/holding court. Its fun to see your court, but not for everyone. While CK games are 4x, they have an aspect of role playing and characters that make them stand out for me. Seeing the characters that make your story is interesting, but its pretty static. Its more for the people that don't purely play it as a grand strategy. Holding court is done well. Instead of getting constant popups, there are a bunch of events that you can roll through when it is convenient for you. If you are in the middle of a crusade or war, you can wait until you're done to go through all of them. They have a lot of flavor, and I haven't seen many repeats. Again, this is probably for the people that don't purely play this as a grand strategy and like the stories and the characters.

3 - Artifact systems - I love these and they are done far better than CK2. Instead of just hiring a smith and paying absurd amounts of money, the system has inspired people with different levels of skill and different events that affect the quality. There are slots and maximum amounts of items that can be equipped, there are inheritances and the ability to demand artifacts back. Its just overall a really good system, and for me this adds a lot.

- Fallo fatal: Sin traducción al Español después varios días del lanzamiento, precisamente en una de las principales características novedosas que traía el dlc y que todos deseábamos explorar.
- el sistema de la corte real me parece pobre. Era de esperar algo mejor después de tanto tiempo, tanto precio y tan pocas novedades.
- el sistema de grandeza de la corte lo debieron implementar los últimos treinta minutos previos al lanzamiento, sube la grandeza con darle a un par de botones.
- poder añadir características a las culturas es un puntazo. me gusta.
- están bien los artefactos y los puestos en la corte, pero me parece una falta de originalidad vergonzosa,¿ no saben inventarse cosas nuevas, y lo único que hacen es repetir lo viejo pero cobrándolo otra vez?

So CK3:TRC adds a few new features. The Court system, and a new culture system among others. I've enjoyed the time I've played with it, as it adds a fresh coat of paint to the CK3 experience. It also adds a decent amount of modding ability for the modders out there. The biggest gripe most people have with it is the pricing, which I can't say I disagree with. It is a bit overpriced for the content added, however in my case I've negated my buyer's regret type of thing by getting the expansion pass... This was the first time I've ever pre-bought a game or dlc for a game. It lives up to the hype in my mind. I would buy it again if I had to, but I would probably wait for a sale.

For the first time buyer/player, I'd highly suggest waiting for a sale, maybe like 10-30% off is best. If you can or can't wait for a sale, get the bundle. You pay for TRC and NL, and also get 2 flavor packs essentially for free. Though I must note when I bought the expansion pass I already had bought NL, so my math may not be perfect.

I hope this helped any future buyers!",1644772140,1644772140,TRUE,1,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198254480640",35,3,0,0,NA,0

The problem is the main selling point of the DLC, seeing the court, seems flat and doesn't add anything. The views aren't detailed enough for you to get a good idea of how all your decorations look unless you zoom in on each on, which defeats the purpose.. Plus, the court room itself doesn't change, so while it seems like it would work fine for a Count at first, when you get to Emperor it feel s like you're ruling from an unfinished closet. I should say it WOULD be good for a Count, as there's no content for tribal rulers, or any position below King. So if you like to start as a count, it's gonna a be awhile before you see anything.

The royal court itself isnt at all intrusive nor impedes game play in anyway. Its pretty dope to see your character actually rule improving immersion a fair bit. I think Paradox did right by focusing on the story element of the game, getting you to actually interact with your courtiers by not having them just be 'there'. The cultural rework speaks for itself as its much needed and they did an excellent on it, getting cultures to actually be different and play differently. Story and characters are the core of what makes crusader kings, Crusader Kings. So im glad to see their really focusing on that aspect first, i think taking certain elements from other GS games would be a good thing and could bode well for the game but first and foremost ck3 needs to have the story and flavor of a CK game, this adds those things very well.

The new culture system is undoubtably a nice addition to the game, adding flavor and giving the player the option to create your own culture. But this feature that some say should have been in the base game already, quickly gets overshadowed by the royal court itself, and it is something special.

The special thing is that the court is at first glance cool and all but those few events that happen, quickly get repetitive and boring. Not to mention that a late game court is ridiculously expensive and unsustainable for a late game empire. The Throne room feels and seems ackward since it is so out of place. The artifact system they brought back from ck2 also feels this way and these factors break the immersion that has been ck for me. The visuals are nice but definetly not what crusader kings needed. 
What it needed was new gameplay additions, for example like they had in ck2 playable republics or more startdates with more character events, flavor for muslims, supernatural events, silkroad, sickness mechanics, crusade mechanics that are actually fun and rewarding for the winner, great project designer, china, horde mechanics, indian flavor, immortality for the absolute chad ruler you are playing, they had all those things and surely many more in ck2, but nothing anyway close this epic in ck3. If you want to experience these things you have to rely on mods.

But by far my biggest compaint is the fact that, this doesnt add anything new and you'll play the game the same way you did before and the fact that they charge 30 bucks for this which is insane. The first flavor pack in ck3 Northern Lords added many fun and interesting events and options for asatru characters. But this lacks in comparison. This, a major expansion which adds practically nothing gameplaywise, lacks in comparison to a flavor pack that added new gameplay mechanics for a fraction of the price. I would honestly not even recommend to wait for a sale here since the obvious right thing to do would be to return back to playing ck2.

Des mois et des mois d'attente pour un DLC qui ne concerne qu'un tier du jeu, les cours ne sont accessibles qu'aux gouvernements féodaux. Pire encore, seuls les rois et les empereurs ont accès à une cour (l'un des mods le plus populaire du workshop y remédie et est sorti le premier jour, voyez la compétence de la communauté face au je-m'en-foutisme de paradox). 

Pour ce qui est de la cour en elle-même les interactions sont maigres, en tant que vassal la plupart du temps les 3/4 des options seront bloquées car hyper spécifiques et franchement pas vraiment utiles, et en tant que seigneur lige vos décisions n'ont aucun réel impacte sur votre économie ou la politique de vos terres. Paradox s'est contenté de rajouter un énième système de loterie à modificateur, choix A modificateur fort +20% sur un stat, choix B modificateur faible +5% sur une autre stat et ça s'arrête là. 

L'intérêt du DLC se résume à la découverte des nouveaux événements pendant une dizaine d'heures, suite à quoi poursuivre une partie (sans rajouter de mod j'entend) devient inutile, puisque ça se résume à blob en boucle étant donné les problèmes d'équilibrages toujours pas corrigé permettant une expansion exponentielle, farmer en boucle les mêmes décisions pour gagner du prestige et de la piété et c'est tout. 

Passez votre chemin si le DLC vous intéresse, passez votre chemin si le jeu vous intéresse, restez bien au chaud sur CK2. Le jeu sera enfin digne d'intérêt et jouable dans 2 ans après la sortie de 8 DLC supplémentaires pour qu'enfin peut être on retourne au niveau de CK2.

The extremely mediocre visuals in the Royal Court, regardless of how much effort they took to make, aren't worth the price-tag or the period of time we've had to wait for them. The actual royal court features, as another reviewer has mentioned, really do just feel tacked on (e.g. I don't believe any events that originate outside the royal court screen ever make it  into the royal court; it's just specific, automatically generated royal court events). They don't seem to have justified the direction this DLC has gone in and they don't really seem to change the way I play. I would have been equally happy with an artefact system that was purely abstract without the visuals. The court is also, at this early stage pretty unbalanced in terms of its costs and potential benefits.

I'm a much bigger fan of the cultural changes. More attention should have been directed towards that side of the game. I'd be much more interested in political and ecclesiastical improvements to religions and more role-playing depth in the church; e.g. introducing improved versions of Catholic Investiture, the papacy, anti-papacies, the Byzantine Empire's imperial system. We're 18 months post-launch and we still don't have even CK2's level of realm management/customisation via laws and council voting. We don't even have regencies.

"771","110131208","110131208","english","I'm recommending Royal Court because I believe that this concept is 'unique' and adds more levels of fun to the game. However it's important to point out that for the current price you're not getting much. 

First let's start with the positives, the special part about Royal Court is the 3D modelling. The new events that can occur from within your throne room are fun to play through and helps make the game last a bit longer by creating more things to do. Furthermore Royal Court introduces changes to the culture system best described as more dynamic now. Following that is the reintroduction of artifacts and different court positions. So there's a good amount of features within this DLC.

But on the contrary to this, Royal Court can be a bit lacking in areas. As a player you get to decide how much money you'd like to spend on your court and sadly it doesn't feel like your financial decisions carry much weight as you alternate your spending. Additionally there isn't much you can do inside your throne room besides tending to random events and holding court, even then there isn't much that visually happens within these events either. It doesn't feel as if they're utilizing the full potential of what they created which is a shame.

However these are baby steps into new territory. Hopefully Paradox keeps the momentum going and does something impressive with how you handle your court in the future. Until then we can only wait and see

Overall if you like playing CK3 and want to purchase DLC for it, you're better off waiting for Royal Court to go on sale first.

"774","110129679","110129679","english","My relatively brief thoughts on each of the new systems:

3D Court Room: So from the start I had a bad feeling about this when they said they wanted to go with a 3D court room, because in my opinion that makes no sense. Paradox makes map games, and map games are what we love from Paradox, they are incredibly unique in that way and there are few other developers we'd consider make ""grand strategy games"". Them trying to create a more RP friendly experience is well and good but I don't think that idea should ever take backseat to actual gameplay and mechanics. The immersion you get from the court is... okay, I guess. It's not something I'm ever excited about, and personally feel looks extremely bland, adding very little to the overall experience.

Culture System: This was what I felt was the true meat and potatoes of the expansion, and a revamped culture system is what I've been wanting for a very long time. However does it really add up to the original hype? Not really. The new systems are nice and definitely will make each playthrough more interesting and more diverse, but ultimately it's a very slow-paced system that you can't utilize all too well until mid-late game when you can accumulate a lot of prestige or decide to make random hybrids just to steal peoples innovations (something I don't care to do because it doesn't make sense from an in-game narrative standpoint, and Paradox is really trying to push roleplay so this doesn't make sense). It's great if you're playing a viking though. I think I'm starting to see a trend with Paradox, hmm.

Language: What in gods unholy name is this? I don't know if I'm just an idiot who can't figure out the most basic thing but this feels not only completely useless mechanically, but also functionless. Learning other languages doesn't seem to actually do anything productive other than add a slight RP flair, which I don't care for. The idea seems nice but I feel like even if it does have some function that I'm not properly making use of, it's still worthless and adds nothing.

Artifacts: Aight here is the big money. I honestly don't have any real complaints about this, I think they did a pretty solid job on it and it's just CK2's system but infinitely better since it works with the court room. You feel like the things you create and collect actually matter in a way, and sure you can probably break the game with some insanely OP items but honestly that is probably part of the fun, just like in CK2.

Minor Titles: I like this quite a lot. At the end of the day it feels almost as pointless as they were in CK2 but they are in fact, not useless. So that is nice. The buffs you get from most of them aren't really noticeable most of the time, but when you start bringing in the cash it adds some more flavor to your playthrough since they can do some neat stuff. During one of my playthroughs I had my trash diplo viking leading armies and he didn't get hurt once, most likely because my bodyguards were actually doing their job. Perhaps I got lucky, but I like to think the feature was doing its job.

Is It Worth It?: I'm probably forgetting some big things but honestly cba about thinking about it. Overall it may seem like my attitude is quite negative towards the DLC but I enjoy it quite a bit, and it will a lot of fun to each of my playthroughs going forward, and since this is one of my favorite games with about 1000 hours into now, it's worth it for me. So for me it's a no brainer, however this is 1000% overpriced. The amount of content it brings to the table feels on par with Northern Lords in size, but obviously more ambitious. If you are having conflicting thoughts about wanting to get it then you should probably wait for a sale, but if you plan on playing a lot like I do, then it's worth it. It's a shame we waited over a year for just this, but I'm hoping this is just the foundation for bigger plans that Paradox has for CK3s future. I understand that the pandemic slowed things down drastically, and we were supposed to get this ages ago so I don't hold that against Paradox, and always am hoping for the best. 

I do hope the DLC pans out well because it would crush me if they canned CK3 like they did with Imperator and many more projects they had in the works. I know it's been a very difficult year for them financially, and part of me is worried this isn't going to help all too much.",1644743456,1644743456,TRUE,40,1,"0.71293795108795166",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198045912753",45,4,0,0,NA,0

Value is subjective, I've certainly enjoyed over 200 hours of it already. I bought it early, for the discount because I trusted paradox to make good content.

The Royal Court part of the DLC itself is a nice feature if you are into roleplay, and it gives you really interesting decisions. I particularly like the court postiions that add important flavor, without being overly convoluted

The new culture system is also really nice, and has cool features like allowing any ruler to become a pirate and raid, 

I've played around 2,000 hours on ck2 with all the dlc, and I can honestly say I prefer ck3 to ck2 at this point, even with some missing features, but there is at least another major dlc coming eventually. There are just so many options in ck3, that aren't in ck2.

I like the idea of divergent, melting pots and hybrids however there should be some drawbacks.

- La cour royale offre une immersion assez agréable, et une dimension RPG cohérente avec ck3. Une feature qui apporte un nouveau challenge si on souhaite développer l'une des plus belles cour royale, et bénéficier de ses bonus qui en découlent. On s'y croit vraiment assis sur le trône, royale :)


- L'ajout d'artefact, et de l'inventaire des personnages permet de personaliser d'avantage notre avatar et offre encore une fois un nouveau challenge RPG, si l'on souhaite pocéder les meilleurs et plus puissants artefacts du jeu. C'est l'élement le plus prometteur qui soit. A voir au niveau de l'équilibre du jeu si tout ces ajouts ne font pas du joueur un demi dieux imbattable trop rapidement dans le jeu.

- La refonte culturel est sympathique, tout comme l'ajout de l'apprentissage des langues, et donne un interet négligé jusque là.

MAIS 

En toute honneteté, le DLC est beaucoup trop cher pour le peu d'ajout apporté. D'autant plus que certaines features sont disponible avec la MAJ. Je le recommande tout de même  pour une immersion supplémentaire, mais clairement le DLC n'a rien d'indispensable dans l'état actuel.

All the events are still basically just pop ups, just inside 3D courtroom space, the event where someone becomes your footstool? Your ruler will not have a footstool within the 3D courtroom. the only thing you can add to your courtroom is artifacts which give measly bonuses and you never spend gold on because it isn't worth it, they just stack up over the course of conquering AI. Also one big glaring problem is that if you are tribal or not at least a king in rank, you don't get a court, so easily over 50% of the starting game just doesn't have a 3D court at all... 

The cultural aspect of the game is interesting but at the same time, there seem to be arbitrary caveats as to when you can reform or divulge, like ""Your culture is not at least 100 years old"", why does that matter if I want to start a different culture?  On top of this there are huge hurdles for what seem again like seemingly small buffs for such a vast amount of effort focusing on it.

3. ARTEFAKTY jsou hezká blbustka se kterou se dá vyplnit dost nudy v pozdejších cástech hry. Jediným problémem je množství, které budete vlastnit po pár hodinách hraní.
4. POZICE U DVORA jsou spíš otravné a nezajímavé, protože krome dvou nebo trí pozic jsou témer všechny k nicemu, stojí hromadu penez a i když je nemáte vubec o nic nepricházíte nijak to gameplay neovlivnuje. 
5. Jako poslední je zde váš vlastní DVUR, ve kterém si mužete vystavit své artefakty a odehrávají se tady eventy s vašimi poddanými, sousedy, rodinou a poskoky od dvora. Zní to hezky ale eventu uvidíte za celou hru maximálne 15 z nejakých 36, pokud nesplníte všechny požadavky, zkrátka jsou všechny na stejné brdo a navíc vetšina má negativní následky a nebo pricházíte o peníze. Vzhled vašeho dvora ovlivníte pouze tím kde se nachází a pravé vystavenými artefakty nic víc, je jedno jestli máte nejúžasnejší dvur na svete protože soused vedle vás bude mít dvur úplne stejný i kdyby ho mel nejhorší.

Cena je obrovská, mám hromadu celých her a ne dodatku za stejnou nebo i menší cenu. Oduvodnéní COVIDem a casem mi prijde hloupé a pokud Paradox ješte dál nerozšírí obsah, který zde zatím je, díky nejaké aktualizaci, tak své kladné hodnocení budu nucený zmenit.

"922","110060900","110060900","english","This DLC is overpriced, yeah I get it. Who cares? This is paradox. People are willing to buy hearts of iron 4 dlc for 15 quid, when it should of been in the game in the first place. This is different, this is content that has never been before seen in any crusader king's titles, lets strip this down a bit into parts. The parts will go in order of what a normal player is likely to see to what a hardcore player is going to see.

Normal Player:
A normal player of this DLC will most likely only scratch the surface, the main bragging points of Royal Court are better cultures, courts with 3D MODELS!!!! And even a little bit of polish sprinkled on top, the first thing I noticed is that the map looks much, much cleaner and the models on the characters are just better somehow. It is hard to describe how great these features are, the less interesting feature (in my opinion) is the inventory system. It brings some very minor bonuses but its pretty cool from a RP standpoint. On a different subject, the RP potential and storytelling this DLC can provide is crazy, I would love to see a Game of Thrones mod with this DLC.

Ironman Player:
For those unfamiliar with Ironman mode, it does not allow saving and is pretty much considered hardcore mode. You will probably be able to reform, diverge or form a hybrid culture with your culture if you are specifically devoted. This can provide some cool bonuses too like ""Malleable Invaders"" which allows hybrid cultures in your realm to form more easily, and this slots in PERFECTLY with the Northern lords too. I suppose since this is a review I do need to beat up the DLC a little, they left tribal ruler's, dukes and counts out of the Courts of the DLC called ""Royal court"", this can make the expansion feel barebone's early game- Especially if you are going for achievements such as ""Rags to riches"" or ""Mother of us all"" which both start early game and usually in tribal realms. Now don't ask me why, but every game I have so far played has been on Iron Man mode, usually starting in a tribal realm. This expansion can feel non-noticeable at times and that does not bode well with the amount of people shitting themselves over the pirce. 

Hardcore Players- I don't consider myself a hardcore player, like a 1000 hours reddit moderator kind of person. The closets I have came to that is a near 200 hours, but that's probably just because when I first started playing this game I was engrossed like a child discovering a bottle with a thing that makes it look ever so slightly look like a rocket. 

My Opinion- This DLC is pretty good, I would not go as far to say it is brilliant. But it is moldbreaking in the sense that it gives the player new RP potential and better yet. custom dynasty banners. Many hours were spent making the Amogus banner, or maybe even the banner of house Lannister. But... I don't get why people are taking it in turns to kick paradox to the ground, like, you already gave them a solid blow to the jaw with the review's on ""Northern Lords"" and you all seem to have atleast 100 hours into the game, so suck it up, take it at face value and see what it really is- A cool DLC that adds cultures and 3D models, if this DLC is not for you, then I get that. But please, please don't go bitching about its price.

For DLC that has been delayed for as long as this one did, it's more than pathetic to have as few new events and limitations that make no sense. 

Do you think it'd be cool to focus on your courtly duties as a count/duke? Nope, only kings and emperors have a place to chill with their courtiers and their vassals just rules from the street, apparently (Fixed by mods) 

Do you want to play as an epic jarl why rules from his badass mead hall? Nope, Paradox thinks tribal governments were a bunch of savages with no concept of a court (Fixed by mods) 

""Oh well, they've spent so much time developing this DLC. Surely they must've made a lot of flavour events"" you might think. Nope, there are about 5 events in your court, 10-15 ""hold court"" events and 5-ish world events. (Yet to be fixed by mods) 

All of it can be excused for a rushed DLC. This one has been delayed by almost a year! 
So get it for mods, but please spit on Paradox. 

Oh, also, inventory system is pretty neat, can't complain there.",1644670479,1644670479,TRUE,1,1,"0.512493550777435303",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198087708972",129,7,0,0,NA,0

"956","110049695","110049695","english","I agree with the consensus on this DLC. It's not bad, but the actual content here feels like it amounts to the patch that usually comes along side a major expansion, rather than an expansion itself. The two primary features here are firstly a court which does very little other than act as a money sink and a store room for items that mostly give you slight prestige bonuses. Secondly, it has culture modifications, which are more substantial but don't seem to offer a huge variance in play style. 

The problem with culture is it still hasn't really changed to be more notable from CK2, which is to say that it's almost irrelevant, providing minor or aesthetic changes rather than sweeping playstyle changes. Mercantile seafaring peoples get some extra income on the coast, highland warriors get some slight bonuses to combat in hills etc. The problem with bland bonuses like that is they don't change at all what you'll actually do in your game - Play a religion that has a lay clergy and you can hold temples. Pagans can raid while unreformed. See the difference between how religion is portrayed and how culture is? Culture feels like background fluff even in the places where it does provide benefits because it provides benefits that don't alter how you play. There's a city builder tradition in the game, but it still doesn't enable you to hold cities as a feudal.

Even for hit and miss DLC in CK2, they tended to change how you played substantially. The Horse Lords was a good example - I am one of the few who enjoyed the clan based government even though it was extremely rudimentary. At the very least it was an actual different experience. All of the CK2 governments felt substantially different to play as.

It does seem like the only reason this has been priced so high is that the court has actual visual representation. All it is at the end of the day is an abstraction of what CK2-3 already had: Events and interactions with other characters. It all seems like a serious overreach for something that doesn't add any new core gameplay experiences. 

CK3 doesn't need to be prettier, it needs more in it. The most important things to the game are religions and government types, and unfortunately that hasn't changed, culture still isn't really that important in that mix beyond what it already was. Which makes the choice to ignore expanding the currently limited options regarding government very strange on the part of Paradox as well.",1644661940,1644661940,FALSE,0,0,"0.494604319334030151",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198008418520",369,11,0,0,NA,0

"959","110049121","110049121","english","Even though the DLC is a pit overpriced it still adds a lot of interesting game mechanics. The royal court mechanic really makes your realm feel more alive, furthermore it adds more play to your economy, by constantly balancing the  level of court grandeur with the amount of gold you can miss. Furthermore, the new culture mechanic really allows for a more dynamic playstyle, that was previously not possible. The artifact system is a cool addition, however you can get so many useless artifacts that it may be difficult to find the ones that are actually good, it can make this system a bit tedious. Paradox should find a way to fix the sorting systems for artifacts because it does not appear to be working for me.

All in all I think the dlc itself is a lot of fun and adds many new elements to the game that were previsouly missing. It is a bit overpriced, but if you buy the royal edition of CK3 the dlc is definitely worth it.",1644661249,1644661249,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198202508787",29,4,0,0,NA,0

Die Erweiterung hat ein paar gute Sachen: Mischkultur erstellen oder sein eigenes Thronsaal ( gut ist Geschmacksache ob man es haben will oder nicht) Artefakten erstellen erinnert mich an CK2 dlc xD braucht man das oder nicht ist auch wieder reiner Geschmacksache. 
Negativ an der Erweiterung meiner Meinung nach ist. Das die Kosten um Zweigkultur  zu erstellen viel zu Hoch sind. Das würde nur gehen wenn man große Königreiche  oder Kaiserreiche besitzt. Sein eigenes  Thronsaal kann man nur betreten wenn man König ist und im Feudalsystem/ Clan ist! Äh ok was ist mit Stammesregierung? Haben die Nordischen Könige keinen Thronsaal auch wenn sie im Stammesregierung sind? 
Das sind die Punkte die mir Negativ aufgefallen sind und verbessert werden muss.

Also für die Anderen die diese DLC nicht besitzen. Wartet erst auf Updates für die Erweiterung und für 10€-20€ kaufen (wenn es Verbessert wurde).",1644658989,1645644281,FALSE,2,0,"0.480190932750701904",0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"76561198038057606",248,4,0,0,NA,0

Look, I love Paradox games, and I consider this DLC essential to the game. So why can't I recommend it? Well it's not JUST the price. It's the fact that they've locked so many basegame features BEHIND such a highly priced DLC. They basically took stuff that was already part of CK2, waited like a year to add it to CK3, and then charged more than 50% of the basegame's price for it. You're not covering any new ground, you're just giving us back features we already have access to from a different game - Other than the 3D rendered royal court, which is cool but very incomplete. You can spend on amenities but nothing visibly changes about your court or courtiers when you get elite fashion or endless servants. When this is on sale for $5 then buy it. No hate toward the workers who made this, just ... The absolute upper limit I'd put on the value of this is $15 which is saying something because it includes what should have been CORE FEATURES of the game ON LAUNCH. The only thing that feels like it should be part of a DLC is the 3D rendered court, which probably took up most of their effort and isn't enough by itself to justify a DLC. The rest is arbitrarily paywalled mechanics you shouldn't have to play the game without. I am seriously concerned about the future updates to CK3 if they intend to keep locking basic features behind DLC paywalls that cost almost as much as the game itself.",1644649587,1644649587,FALSE,6,0,"0.523809552192687988",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198059284587",149,32,0,0,NA,0

So, I got the season pass  to get the first couple of DLC for free back when I got the game because I'm too impatient to wait for things to go on sale, and I play Paradox games, I know how this all works. So now that it's come out, it feels like I've gotten this DLC for free. Props to past me. 

The DLC is a blast! It adds a lot of flavor and variety, and just a lot more roleplaying and personality to the characters in the game. After several failed attempts I was able to re-enact the Norman Conquest and go about making London home to the grandest royal court in the world. Grand courts give a lot of positive modifiers, including to people's willingness to be recruited to your court, which gives a nice reliable way to invite talented people into your kingdom beyond marrying them in. 

Collecting artifacts is great fun, and balancing how much to spend on investing in your realm the old fashioned way versus getting nice new tapestries to hang up in your hall is pretty engaging. Some of the items you get are really powerful, especially in boosting prowess. With some famed armor and a famed weapon you're looking at well over +9 prowess, which you can pass down to your inbred fragile heirs to keep them alive. You can also gift artifacts to those clouts who hooked their way into your council, potentially buffing their doomed lines into some semblance of sentience. It's nice to see the nepotism of the medieval ages develop a couple of pros to balance the many many cons. 

The biggest criticism I have of the DLC is that I'd love to see more. I want to see more types of throne rooms, including a grand wooden feasting hall for tribals and norse Kingdoms. I want to see Empire titles unlock even more court positions and new mechanics in the same way reaching Kingdom opens up the court. I want more room to display my artifacts, I want more banners on the walls, an even larger court, more rooms to visit like the prisons and a treasury. Heck, medieval courts (especially pre 1066) often traveled, I'd love to be able to have more than one royal court, let me set up and decorate a winter palace separately from my summer palace, etc. The UI for gifting artifacts could and should also be improved.

That said, Royal Courts stands as an exciting addition to the game which adds a LOT of fresh content. Holding court is blast, the new events are great, commissioning artifacts is addictive. If you want to continue to support a gem of a game and have fun doing so, buy the DLC. If you can't afford it, wait for a sale, but this is definitely one you'll want to pick up at some point.

- Royal Court is very ordinary and ""meh"" with only a handful of generic events. Courts are Eurocentric and aside from the architecture, nothing changes no matter where you are on the map. Nothing at all for Tribal kings, but they still get the penalties to vassal opinions? Completely breaks the game if you don't play Feudal essentially. 

- Artifacts are really generic and ordinary. Not really worth anything. 

- The culture mechanics, while a great idea that adds loads to the game, is very badly implemented. Many of the mechanics just aren't realistically usable due to insane costs and/or time constraints. This means these mechanics might as well not be in the game at all, making the entire thing a waste of time. 

Overall content is low, and aside from the graphics assets with Royal Court, appear to mostly be low effort. You can cover the entire DLC in the first hour of gameplay. Making it boring and pointless. 

On launch are insane bugs, such as invincible AI armies, regular crashes, save file corruptions, AI getting stuck in endless wars etc. etc.

You can tell that not only did they not test the game properly, they have actually not played the game to see if their mechanics are even viable. It feels like a couple of people slapped this together in their weekends or something.

If this DLC had cost maybe $10 and was much better balanced making the content actually usable, it would be ok and I'd give it a thumbs up. But for the price being charged, is a complete and utter ripoff.

Though I have a distinct feeling this is just a ploy by paradox to get people to do their DLC subscription service by making these shoddy expensive dlcs and make it seem like a cheaper alternative to spend 5 bucks a month than 30 up front.

The royal court system just feel empty, with only one or two events popping up every few years. Holding court just gives you 3-4 decision events that cause little effects to your wider realm and at times feel sloppily thrown together. I once had a count requesting vassalage under me and then the very next person, happens to be his kid brother requesting me to declare war on my new vassal and place him as count. Then after that, you gotta wait for another 5 years for another 4 events. You get 21 new courts positions, but if you go into your court the max amount of people you really see are 10 randos middling about. 
The relic system also feel mediocre. In your court you are allowed only 3 Banners, 3 small trophy, 3 furniture and 4 centerpieces with only two distinct types of relics, court and personal (which you can equip). You can turn your personal relic into a court relic but not the other way around. So if you want to wear the Crown of Justinian as you lead your empire, you can't because its only purpose is to be on display in 1 of 4(!!!!) slots in your court. So as a large empire with 20 plus relics, you're really not displaying the power and majesty of your court and more showing off a bit of nick knacks to your house guests.

I can deal with the price that isn’t really my biggest issue, my biggest issue is the number of bugs myself and others have found in a DLC that the pushed back multiple times, I would understand the number of bugs if this was a mod but it’s not! some of the bugs are huge and I have no idea how paradox have missed them, The game is unplayable in ironman mode due to game breaking bugs that have tagged along with this DLC.
 I feel this doesn’t add enough to the game for what is meant to be a big DLC, don’t get me wrong i enjoy royal court even with the issues stated I personally wish that paradox had put more effort into this. the hype was huge for this and it’s kind of just let me down. Its not a great day when the best thing about this game is going to be the mods and not something from paradox themselves. If you have read this far and are still undecided on if you should get the DLC , I would say maybe wait for the DLC to go on sale. Waiting for this will allow them(hopefully) to fix the bugs and gives you the DLC at a more balanced price for the content you are getting.

The various court positions, throne room grandeur, and artifacts also adds a lot of flavor.

"1081","110005780","110005780","english","I wish there was a maybe option for recommending things on Steam. I don't want to say that I don't recommend this, because I did enjoy this expansion. But at the same time, it doesn't feel right to recommend it in it's current state/pricing.
I'll summarise: 

1. Is it fun? - Yeah, adding actual 3D spaces to see your characters in gives the world a more 'lived in' feel. I', very curious to see how they would expand on this in future, adding more 'scenes' as it were e.g. banquet hall, battle fields, council chambers etc..
That being said, I personally feel that the real 'meat' of this expansion has nothing to do with the Royal Court itself, but rather the much requested culture rework. Also seems weird to exclude tribal rulers from having a court. You wanna tell me Genghis Khan didn't have a court? And why is there no native freecam option? I wanna see my grossly inbred King's face up close dammit!

2. Was it worth waiting for? - Depends on how long you were waiting for it. If you count from when they started selling the 'Royal Edition' prior to the base release that's almost two years. Obviously Covid threw a wrench into everything, but even so, I don't think the amount of content added by this DLC justifies how long people have had to wait for it. This is something that absolutely cannot be repeated by Paradox.

3. Is it worth the price? - LOL NO. See above. This is the most expensive DLC Paradox have ever released. Hell I got this through the Royal Edition and I feel a little shortchanged by it.

The DLC is very expensive for what it actually brings, and the wait for it hasn't helped.
The culture changes are very good and the highlight of the update. Though most of the feature are part of the free update anyway.
The court mechanics feel very barebones, something you spend a couple minutes in every 5 years. The fact that dukes and tribal's don't get courts doesnt feel right, nevermind the fact that the court designs are very limited and don't suit everywhere playable (no norse court?? when already had norse dlc).
I feel paradox have tried something new with the art/graphical side and it just hasn't paid off, who plays these games for the graphics.

TL;DR If this DLC is reasonably priced is for you to decide, but it sets out to be the most ambitious DLC yet and in that it succeeds.

It’s hard to develop DLC for a sequel to a beloved game like Crusader Kings 2. On the one hand if you only add features already present in the prequel, people are miffed to be paying for the same features all over again. But if you only add completely new features people will start complaining about your priorities and form factions to demand their favourite feature be added to the game right now.
To circumvent this problem Paradox decided on a compromise for Royal Court, adding a completely new dynamic culture system, a 3D throne room, and reintroducing a fan favourite: artifacts.
Royal Court is considered the first major DLC for Crusader Kings 3, with a grand price tag of $30. This sets the bar high for Royal Court. To meet expectations, it must try to be more ambitious than any CK2 DLC ever was. Let’s see if it succeeds at this.

[b] Culture system [/b]
At launch Crusader Kings 3 distinguished itself from its predecessors by having a dynamic faith system. It not only had more religions, but also allowed players to start their own religion, greatly improving replay value and the RPG potential of the game.
With Royal Court a similar system is implemented for culture. Cultures are no longer one-dimensional but consist of various cultural pillars. Players and AI can now reform these pillars over time. Most significant of these pillars are the traditions. A culture can have up to 5 traditions at game start and there is a large amount of them in the game giving access to a variety of bonusses and mechanics. Most traditions are meaningful, and a well customized culture can greatly help lean into a certain playstyle.
Reforming a culture is not the only way cultures change in the new system. There is also the possibility of diverging from your culture. Diverging a culture is instantaneous and allows for faster customization if prestige is plentiful. As such it does lack the long-term planning that comes with reforming a culture. A third option is hybridizing, merging two cultures. Like diverging, hybridization is instantaneous, but does require some long-term planning as certain amount of cultural acceptance is needed before hybridization is possible.
With the added complexity of languages, ethoses and traditions to culture and with the addition of three ways to dynamically change cultures, Royal Court adds a lot of content and greatly increases the replayability. With this new culture system Royal Court proves it is willing to take an ambitious leap and back it up with quite the amount of content.

[b] Royal Courts [/b]
Also new with this DLC is its namesake, the royal court, visualized as a 3D throne room filled with courtiers. This space is used to stage some events in and represent the state of your court, abstracted to a value called grandeur. Grandeur can range from 0 to 100 and is mostly decided by your willingness to spend money on it, either through amenities or hiring people to fill court positions. Because money is relatively easy to come by in CK3, grandeur isn’t hard to max out. Because of this and the fact that an increase in grandeur only results in bonusses, there isn’t really any trade-off to grandeur and doesn’t present the player with any meaningful choice.
The virtual throne room looks visually stunning and does succeed in making the court feel more alive, expanding the RPG aspect of CK3 further. The court is however only visible in a window separate from the map where players will spend most of their time. To counter this the developers added events that pop-up in this window and the decision to hold court that present the player with a string of events, but players might find they still only occasionally check the court window.
With the addition of the royal court the developers take a risk by adding something very few people requested. It’s an ambitious step to utilize Clausewitz 2’s 3D capacity and elevate the game’s role-playing capabilities. But because players will only spend a limited time in the virtual court, there is only just enough content to justify it as a feature. Hopefully future DLC and patches will expand on this feature and give the player more stuff to do at court.

[b] Artifacts [/b]
One thing visible in your court not mentioned yet are artifacts. A first for Crusader Kings, artifacts actually show up as 3D models when added to a court. The virtual court is however not the only place artifacts might be collected. Characters also have a personal inventory, where artifacts that can be carried on their person are represented. Artefacts are primarily acquired via inspired characters, who can be sponsored to start crafting items, and there is an assortment of events that determine the outcome of the crafting process.
The total number and variety of artifacts added in Royal Court match those of CK2, even though CK2 needed multiple DLC to get to the same amount. This quantity of artifacts shows Royal Court is willing to go the extra mile to catch up and possibly even overtake CK2 DLC content.

[b] Conclusion [/b]
Having reviewed all this, we return to the question of if Royal Court adds more content than any of CK2’s DLC did, as its price tag seems to indicate. The answer to that question could be yes, especially when considering the amount of 3D models included in this DLC. Though the amount features added is limited, the culture system and artifacts especially are supported by an impressive amount of content.
Does this mean that $30 is a reasonable price to pay for Royal Court? That is a question only you can answer and one which heavily depends on your interest in the included features. It is undoubtedly a hefty sum to pay for a DLC, but if any Crusader King DLC is worth $30, it is Royal Court.
One important caveat is that this DLC does focus quite strongly on feudal kings and emperors and forgets about vassals and tribal rulers. While playing as a tribal or vassal can be just as interesting as playing a feudal king, Royal Court barely expands gameplay for these particular playstyles as they do not have access to courts or court artifacts.",1644607887,1644607887,TRUE,2,1,"0.481481492519378662",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198071632956",80,20,0,0,NA,0

The quality is there, and judging from all the reviews a lot of people purchased it spite of the price. Did you really think any DLC is going to be worth this price? I knew it would not, but I bought it anyway. Why? well because CK3 is awesome and I love playing it so anything that makes it better is great. Complaining about the price means nothing if you bought it as Paradox will not drop the price anytime soon and if you don't buy it then you are stuck waiting 6 month until they do. Paradox knows it is a very popular game and the hardcore fans will pay regardless (we are hooked LOL). Sure it's worth about $15 tops, so if you want to wait then wait. I personally have spent almost twice as much on meals that last an hour and they are  done. I would rather skip the takeout for 1 week and enjoy this game.  Like others have said before, if you are sinking more than 100 hours + on a game that you really enjoy, is dropping $20 to $30 every 6 months really a bad thing? C'mon! the free workshop creations that you can download that are are possible with new DLCs is worth it alone. If you enjoy CK3 why wait? Possibly Paradox will learn and listen but if you worked hard on something and sold it at a premium because it was in high demand would you not do the same?

"1166","109983494","109983494","english","TL:DR: I think that the DLC, while fun, is purposefully overpriced to try and get people to buy the expansion pass. 

I personally have had a lot of fun with this DLC, from forming Indian Vikings who raid overseas with war elephants, to making the kingdom of Sardinia a quasi-trade republic by reforming their culture to have bonuses to ports, farms, and guilds. However, for what is on offer here, I find the price that it's at to be too high, mainly because I want more out of $30. However, I think this is the point. 

If you go and check the price of the season pass, at the time of writing this, it is about $35 before any discounts. It's going to be worth watching the price of that season pass, because if it goes up by the time I'm writing this, then Paradox may be trying to get people to buy a more expensive season pass in order to get a little extra out of customers before any other dlc/flavor-pack/whatever get's released in the first place. The pass was $35 before royal court or northern lords ever came out, and if it goes up, then, to me, it's confirmed that they're trying to prey on people who think, ""yea, the season pass is more expensive, but it means I'll get access to future updates and not get left behind with something that is overpriced.""

To sum it up, if you REALLY want this dlc now, get the season pass. If you are willing to wait for sales, then please do so, and if the price of that season pass DOES go up, then, Paradox, that seems like a really slimy marketing strategy. 

Looking back at it now, that might be why Northern Lords is $15 dollars as well.

I feel like people are not truly appreciating how big of a deal the 3D throne room is. I have been dreaming of something that added exactly this since release of CK2. Adds the final level of immersion that gets you lost in your sandbox world, cultures and characters feel way more dynamic and well real.

As it stands, even with the price tag, personally I think it add a lot of flavour, suddenly characters come alive with the court and the events seem way more natural and memorable since you trigger certain events from your court, outside of holding court. Haven’t had a lot of time to fully flesh it out but it seems to run well and provide a lot unique artefact events as well as other unseen possibilities.

The only cons I see are it is limited the royal court to only kings and emperors, also you need to be feudal so a big chunk of the map doesn’t really benefit and I personally prefer being a dukedom or duke under a king, at least to start. But I imagine this will get added later on with DLCs probably and more flavour packs.

If you play Paradox games you know what to expect. In the end this is one of the better DLCs I’ve ever bought from them. For sure a lot of mechanics and flavour that add a lot to the game, expensive but if you have the cash and are eager to game, I think it is worthwhile. It won’t break your game or anything strange. 

I felt the strong need to add a positive comment because I am tired of seeing the toxic and angry part of the Paradox community just downvote released like mad just because it is expensive or they don't think it is enough. The answer is simple enough for people who don't like what the company is doing, just stop buying the game or what for a sale. But stop just spamming downvotes because you don't like the DLC model.

It was delayed for stability and I am fine with that however I guess it should have been delayed a bit longer. I can not play a game for more than 20 minutes with out one of the following happening; Game stops responding, Crash report window pops up, Computer freezing, or my favorite BSOD. At first my crash reports tried to do the very best they could but after submitting around 20 they may have devolved into ""Trying to play the game.""

Now for the price, this game costs more than half the base game and as such I expected a fair transformative product. However even if we take into account the free update [which I am not since most of it is there to support the paid content] this is not worth the price. I did not play CK2 but from what I have gathered they are adding back functionality from a previous title slowly. But honestly aside from the court positions that are part of the free game I don't think there is much here. 

I was gifted the DLC for my birthday since it came out a day before and I feel like the person that bought it for me got robbed That is how wholly inadequate I think this product is for the price. It is probably more at home at around 12.99 but it is hard to justify any more than that.

Perhaps my opinion will change in the future, infact I hope it does. I guess my final closing statement is please delay things until they are done, you have been doing the people who purchase your DLC dirty lately and we all know it.

The price of the DLC, and time it took to come out is mostly due to lockdowns, so it's understandable.

Over the past few years, Paradox has more often than not released DLC that has failed to meet consumer expectations. Paradox developers have noted the challenges of dealing with COVID-19 and working from home arrangements, but their decline in quality and the overpricing of DLC begins as early as EU4's The Cossacks (for which I wrote a very lengthy negative review, hence why I specifically remember it), released nearly 7 years ago at the end of 2015. COVID-19 is not the problem.

At pain of making this review far longer, I could continue on about my speculations regarding Paradox Development Studios and how it's operated, and why this is causing problems. But reviews have a character limit, so I will reserve my remarks on PDS to this: STRATEGISE your time better, re-evulate how you value features, do not assume more time = more value.

[b]The DLC's added content: is it good?[/b]

It's just... okay. You couldn't say the content is 'awful'; the added depth to cultures is a welcome addition, the inventory and combat systems something I missed from CK2 and glad to have back, and the new royal court and its many new positions fairly mediocre but not [i]awful[/i] features.

Is the new content enjoyable, though? Not really. Not that it has made the game less enjoyable, but I can't say it has made the game more enjoyable either. The way I play CK3 hasn't really changed from before Royal Court. The features, though not awful, feel  ""tacked on"". They don't offer new ways to play, but merely supplement the existing gameplay loop. Aside from needing to keep your court's grandeur above the expected threshold, you could validly completely ignore your royal court and it would make no serious impact upon gameplay.

Engaging with your royal court also becomes quite tedious. I was surprised to find after checking CK3's Royal Court event files that there are 86 (as I counted) general royal court events, yet while playing it feels as though there are only 10-15. The issue is that many events rely upon specific conditions that are unlikely to change throughout a character's life. Many, for example, rely upon certain court positions being occupied, but as a vast majority of them cost 0.50 to 1.50 gold to upkeep, it is simply too expensive to have more than a handful of courtiers employed at any given time until the late game (by which time, given how easy CK3 is, most have stopped playing out of boredom). Consequently, you are faced with the same set of events again and again.

I'd also note that it [i]seems[/i] a majority of court events are negative, usually resulting in you losing money, prestige, and relations with one or more vassals. Positive outcomes are rare and not rewarding enough when holding court more often leads to negative outcomes. Events where gold is lost is especially harsh when your court grandeur threshold requires dedicating almost your entire income to court amenities.

And, on that note, the cost of court amenities and salaries scale awfully. Tying court costs to eras results in expense hikes completely disconnected from the pacing of the game. Income game design has been made to grow gradually as you invest in buildings and increase county development over time, but the +25% hike in court costs is instantaneous upon entering a new era. To use my current game starting as West Francia as an example, I formed the empire of Francia and rule over essentially eight de jure kingdoms. This makes my court grandeur expectation level 10, meaning I essentially need full court amenities. Going from Tribal to Early Medieval instantly increased my court amenities cost by 10 gold and made many of the court positions I had filled no longer affordable to maintain as their salaries also hiked by +25%.

This meant I needed to make many court positions vacant, meaning less interaction with courtiers and less event flavour, as well as it disrupting the flow of gameplay completely as I had to suddenly shift towards buildings and development all of a sudden without any graduality- a shift that is hard to do, given its reliance on stable income and time. I don't feel as though this janky kind of gameplay is the kind of gameplay intended, especially given how disjointed it is from CK3's game design approach to income.

Final issue I have with the royal court is the royal court view itself. Court artefacts, especially pedestal artefacts, look awkwardly out of place. After filling out all the artefact slots, your court more resembles a museum storeroom than it does a royal court. It begs the question why this feature was even implemented when it really serves no purpose.

I recall reading in a dev diary that a significant amount of coding went into adapting the engine so that the royal court could be visually represented. [i]Why?[/i] Several times in the past (after repeated controversies around pricing) Paradox has justified the price of their DLCs upon the time and effort they invested into developing them. The issue with such an approach is obvious: consumers don't value time and effort, they value quality and content.

Accounting for how feature-poor this [i]very expensive[/i] DLC is, I can't help but feel Paradox felt justified in their pricing due to the time they poured into coding and troubleshooting the engine to support the court visuals. Not only are these visuals very [i]average[/i] and completely lacking responsive variation (why doesn't my court change when I pour money into luxury amenities? why doesn't it look like a rundown shelter when I neglect it?), it serves zero gameplay function. Here, I believe, Paradox made a HUGE misjudgement, placing far too much value in the visuals.

CK3 is a [i]grand strategy game[/i]. While the visual representation of characters is highly appropriate for CK3's core gameplay, it being centred around the lives of individuals, it was unnecessary to extend that as far as visually representing the royal court, especially when doing so was so costly and needing further development of an already greatly functional engine. Frankly, it was a complete waste of time and money.

I think most players would have been equally as satisfied with simply a flat interface similar to the inventory system that represented the artefacts on display in their court, not needing the extensive effort that was invested into showcasing those artefacts visually. Interacting with characters in this interface is a hopeless affair. It has never been helpful and I continue to use either the council panel or courtiers panel. In fact, more often it becomes an inconvenience, as the intuitive and fantastic tooltip system CK3 introduced to Paradox's games doesn't work as fluidly with the royal court interface, it blocking the display of panels and requiring me to exit the court view during court events to check a character's aptitude for court positions they're requesting, or to check titles relevant to a court event as the title panel is also completely blocked when in the royal court view.

I believe the crux of this DLC's issue lies in the decision to have the royal court visualisation. If all the time and effort that went into implementing new engine code instead was dedicated to new mechanics, interactions, and flavour, there is no doubt this DLC would have been better received. The fact that the Northern Lords flavour pack actually changed the gameplay loop by offering new ways to play by varying choices and interactions, while this mainline major expansion fails to do so and sits more as an idle supplement and less a game changing major expansion, says a lot to how significantly those who direct Paradox's projects misunderstand what makes their games fun, engaging, and replayable.

Paradox Development Studios HAS talented staff, capable of making quality products, but I believe PDS's management of time and valuation of features is deeply flawed.

First I'll address the reason why the DLC has been review bombed,

The price of Royal Court might be a little steep for some, but the DLC helps fund the free patch content. A lot of the issues people have expressed in regards to the pricing wouldn't have been expressed if the free patch content was included with the expansion under the same price, and not available for all. You're basically getting half the DLC content for free, but you can pay for the *full* thing (including the free content) if you want it. It helps to fund the continued development of the game, which allows Paradox to continue to support their games for as long as they do.

Plus, if you have a group of friends you play with consistently, only one of you (the host) needs to own the DLC.

With that out of the way,

POSITIVES
- fits seamlessly into the standard CK3 gameloop and doesn't feel like a gimicky add-on
- seeing the characters in court and interacting with them brings them to life and makes you care about them a lot more
- gives you more to do during down-time and adds a lot of flavour to the game, which was sorely needed
- very pretty 3D models

NEGATIVES
- at present the artifacts system, which is a base game feature but featured most prominently in the expansion, focuses too much on generic and low-level items, and artifact bloat is even worse than in Crusader Kings II
- some minor issues with polish and bugs, particularly in loc texts which has some spelling and grammar issues, though we can expect these to be fixed with time

Artefacts you collect are represented with generic 3d models that do not resemble the item itself in any way, this could be a glitch but I'm 99% sure this is just working as intended. Eg, a small bust I found is represented by a bronze eagle statue.
Your weapons and armour do not even appear on your character, what is the point of this? Why bother forging or collecting a rare sword or piece of armour if you can't see it in-game outside of the 2d icon representing it in the menu.

Still, it is a good edition to the game, but I'm saying no due to price so paradox can think about this.",1644538027,1644538027,FALSE,7,1,"0.497267842292785645",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198064439937",359,71,0,0,NA,0

The royal court adds excellent mechanic that makes CK3 a lot more challenging and enjoyable. Previously you were swimming on prestige and money once you got your ball rolling. Not anymore. It will take a long time to establish good kingdom and culture.

Why yes? I like court system, court events and these artifacts you can get from battle, from crafter or as a gift by your vassal or guests. 

Why not? I say, it is overprice DLC. I bought my Royal Court DLC from Greenmangaming in discount and I feel it was worth it. 30€ doesn't even fit to this. I would say around 10-15€ so if price tag is terrifying you. I recommend to check other sites or wait more until this DLC get discounted in steam. DLC also bring some bugs.

We were promised a completely game changing experience and it's not that. The reason I bought it was, mostly because I know Paradox. The free updates are never really worth it without the dlc, lots of cool buttons left unclickable until you buy something. Wanting to see exactly what this cool new 3D court system was. And man am I underwhelmed. Again, it's not a bad DLC at all. It adds cool things, and some useless. Like the language. It doesn't matter. Languages don't matter at all unfortunately. It would be a really cool addition if it wasn't so hyped up. We had to wait extra time due to covid, and that's okay I understand that. We saw what working from home did to CyberPunk 2077, without the ability for devs to test the games on consoles. So I don't mind  that it took a while. But it's just not game changing. It isn't what was promised. I think most of the time went to designing everything in 3D and making sure it worked, and nothing really interesting was added. This isn't worth $30. It isn't worth $30 at all. I would say it's barely worth $15. Paradox has entire games that cost less than this, let alone better DLC's that cost less. Don't do what I did. Don't get caught up thinking you need it for the better game experience. And don't get caught up in the hype the YouTubers are giving this DLC. 

Is it good? Yes.
Is it what was promised? No.
Is it worth the money? Absolutely not.

I enjoy the DLC and find much of the content a welcome addition to the game. It is a good start to the Ck3 content and includes a lot of features that flesh out the already excellent base game. 

However, this is Paradox's most expensive DLC and do not forget that word 'DLC', while this is marketed as an expansion it is just more content. If this had many more mechanics and actual gameplay styles I would perhaps consider the price worthy. But it is not. It is far more expensive than additions such as Old Gods for CK2, Utopia for Stellaris, Art of War for EU4 and Waking the Tiger for HoI4 while not nearly being as important as any of these.

I understand that CK3 is supposed to be the next generation of Paradox Games and is consequently going to be much more expensive. However, the quality of the product must match the price.

[b] MY PERSONAL random opinions about this dlc [/b]
(*Not my native language so humble yourselfs when reading what i wrote*)
-Most of their development efforts were spent on graphics which left the expansion lacking so we have barely enough content in our hands i will say examples later on.
-Overpriced (For my country at least)
-Buggy
-Hybrid and Diverge options are dumb for big countrys 
-It takes to long to change peoples cultures bec you do it one at a time. 
Why can't i just ****ing raze half of my country and rebuild it with gold ?
-Can't migrate people that has my cultures or other cultures to change my or other cultures or hybird it indirectly and other things that this dlc needs
-Not enough culture options to choose and 20000 prestige for some shitty reform that i won't use ?  
-There is a limit to adding culture to the culture tree, I can't reform even if I have prestige 
-We have jobs but 75% of them are bu****it. 
-Important events and jobs are missing for example: We have a court of some sort but if i am 0-16 who the **** is managing ? Why can't i play him for 0-16 years. Why didn't they add such interesting specials and events?
-Only 2-5 new units and some random regional special cultures for a major update
-If i am a tribal or clan goverment type i don't get events like feudal goverment 
-It seems tribal and clan goverments doesn't speak with their people vassals etc
-I still can't play republic and theocratic government types
-Where is other goverment types ?

The Court itself is nothing else than a 3D-Box with events and some additional layers, nothing that is really interesting and it starts to repeat very fast.

Pros:
- Fletched out new systems: Artifacts, Culture
- New systems that adds flavor: Courts, Customization of Banners/Crests
- Tons of new ways to play the game with 10+ new Court Positions and Culture divergences.
- Great Mod-Support, playing the DLC with supported mods can increase the size of it ten-fold. (The mods are also high quality, just look through the Crusader Kings 3 Twitter Feed)

Cons:
- Can feel a little extra spammy with pop-ups at times
- The 'Hold Court' Interaction and Random Court Interactions sometimes feel pointless, tedious and may take more away than it gives.

People need to chill with their ranting about the price-tag.
This DLC changes your entire game, and it comes with a free major update for anyone less interested.
All cultures are changed with new systems, fundamentals and progressions, which changes the flow of your -entire- playthrough. 
They did it in a good way too, that adds depth but doesn't make it tedious. 
The artifacts are nice rounded system, which if you truly dig into, can boost and bolster your entire empire to almost overpowered extremes. 

Suggestions for improvement:
- Change the court scene in an Empire, so that it doesn't just appear as a Kingdom Court
- More customizations options for the court itself, so that we may make it a bit more personal (beyond artifact showcases)
- Balance the 'Dual for Artifact' interaction, can't believe a 40 prowess absolute mountain of a man can lose to a 91 year old granny
- Reduce the amount of random cultural divergences happening, as it gets quite overwhelming
- Generally reduce the spread of random cultures and hybrid cultures everywhere, as it feels as though you can't even hope to have an empire of the same culture anymore.
- Make more options to interact with the new court positions (Jester, Bodyguard, etc.) as currently it's almost always the same random prompts you get.

Overall, I recommend this DLC even at it's price-point. Though, with free update adding in a bunch of the quality content anyway, I can understand why you'd let this one simmer a bit till they update it once more.",1644515784,1644515784,TRUE,5,0,"0.544105231761932373",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198047455838",377,21,0,0,NA,0

Gestion des événements de la cour, personnalisation de l'apparence de celle-ci, artefacts, fonctions à distribuer pour les courtisans, création du blason.

Toutes ces choses auraient put être autant de petit dlc à 10/15 euros chacun mais la c'est un seul gros dlc.

Seul bémol, il me semble que la cour n'est pas disponible pour les Ducs et Comtes, je n'ai testé que Roi pour l'instant mais j'imagine dans ce cas la possibilité d'interagir avec celle de son suzerain s'il y en a un.

Cela rajoute bien évidement des centaines d'heures de jeu pour les plus passionnés, sans compter les mods qui vont utiliser ces nouvelles fonctionnalités.

Dans mon cas CK3 n'est pas mon jeu paradox favoris et j'ai passé un bon moment et envisage d'y jouer plus depuis ce dlc

Donc je recommande ce dlc si vous aimez le jeu tout simplement.

Now they released this single expansion at the price of 30 euros, which makes it the most expensive PDS dlc ever. Their main excuse for the increased pricepoint was that the expansions for CK3 would be massive and gamechanging, however, RC adds barely enough content to be priced at 20 euros (like holy fury for CK2), I would even say that 15 is a more suitable price. Most of their development efforts were spent on making the court itself, which left the expansion lacking in substance in regards to mechanics, pretty graphics is not content.

This expansion makes me worry that the decision to go 3D for CK3 was a bad one, as it maimed their development time by forcing to allocate resources to make the 3D models work. If their following expansions are also gonna take so long to release and will spend so much effort on graphics over new game mechanics - CK3 will never reach it's true potential.

If the expansion arrived 6 months sooner and was priced at 15-20 euros, most of the complaints would be gone. Sadly that was not the case and after waiting for almost a full year we got what feels like a dissappointment.

Royal Court ist eine wunderbare Erweiterung zu dem Spiel und es fördert die Immersion des Spiels wie nichts was ich jemals zuvor in einem Crusader Kings Game erleben durfte. Der Königshof lädt die Spieler geradezu ein am Spielgeschehen teilzunehmen, indem die Spieler endlich richtige Anfragen, Bitten und Wünsche ihrer Vasallen und ihrer Höflinge erhalten. So wie es im mittelalterlichen Feudalsystem nun mal war.

Ist das DLC deshalb perfekt: Nein. Es gibt noch vieles das ausgebaut und verbessert werden sollte. Wie die Anzahl der möglichen Events, die Möglichkeit auch als Herzog einen solchen Hof zu haben oder auch der ein und andere Bug. Potential gibt es massenweise und ich bin mir sicher das Paradox mich da in Zukunft nicht enttäuschen wird.

The only criticism I have is that tribal nations are completely left out which makes no sense as they too would have had courts of their own, as well as dukes regardless of being independent or a vassal, which is also another major reason for the negative feedback.

I really like the new culture system and that it is tied into the existing culture ""tech tree"" system. Now you need to consider a lot more of pros and cons of which culture you belong to. I like it better than the separated systems from ck2, and I hope to see it causes the world to be more diverse, on top of the diversity of government type and religion. 

Inventory system is a good, and a good foundation for mods and stuff to come.
Not so pleased with the court UI, holding court, hiring artisans and setting displays in the court itself is a lot of repetitive clicking, but can be improved as feedback checks in. Many good new events in the court, many dependant on two AI characters internal relations so now you have more reason to get to know your vassals not only in relation to you, but between themselves.I hope they dont become too repetive. 

I do get why the lower noble titles dont get a full court, it is better this way, it keeps the new options reserved for greater powers, instead of watering it down to be accessible to some degree for all. Also, it is not ""locked"", you are just expected to take part in your lieges court instead, and there is plenty to gain from it. 

I dont like that more actions are put into the existing advisors roles. Especially the steward has way too many important tasks to do, and he can't split his attention, instead has to focus 100% on one out of many important tasks.  I might not have encountered a ""passive"" cultural shift mechanic yet, but I feel it could be needed, unless the steward unloads to some jobs to other advisors.  

It is fair for people to critizise the price, but I am a big fan of starting out with dedicating DLC to developing strong foundations for core mechanics, and this is important for the main game but also for modding. There is much work put into this, culture is huugely important, and is not at a scale similar to the new religion system which is also a great foundation for many years of modding and expansions. New ""content"" like government types and regional content can come along the way. Maybe if the developers helped us understand the minor new features better, like ""700 new dialogues"" alongside ""inventory system"" it would help people understand what they are paying for. It takes time to encounter it all, yet here we are giving thumps up and down within 24 hours of release.

Don't get me wrong what they have added are some cool features but not DLC worthy, more like a larger flavour pack. It's also worth saying that you can only access the actual ""Royal Court"" part of the DLC when youre a King/Queen or Emperor/Empress and not the lower titles that most playthrough start as.

"1483","109923261","109923261","english","Update: After some 20+ hours of play and strategic cultural mixing (cultures main function seems to be to quickly knock out some innovations by hybridization) finally made it feudal and got my royal court. And boy, what a let down it is. Seriously, what is this? Visually, looks as bad as in the development diary pictures. Awkward few second animation loops or completely static characters. Functionally pointless. The court grandeur is just a punitive system (get to a certain level by spending gold to avoid punishments) with limited benefits (good to know that as Emperor people are now more willing to accept my children for tutoring...) Events are meh, 3 petitioners asking for random stuff, usually money or court appointment. But they don't even play out in court, it is still a textbox. The thrown-together ""adult"" visual novels that flood the new release page of steam have more visual interactivity than the royal court. Most of the time it is easy to forget that there is even a royal court, so disconnected it is from everything else: it is basically a completely self-contained subsystem because somebody at Paradox just doesn't understand that I did not want a dollhouse to display their mediocre 3D assets.

Ultimately does Royal Court make the game better? Not really, its additions are disconnected and have very limited affect on how the game is played. Does it make it worse? Kind of, royal courts are just a massive resource sink, court positions are convoluted, and culture now overlaps with religion in weird ways. What the DLC definitely does is put a nail in the coffin of any hope that Paradox can or is interested in delivering major additions to the underlying game.

I had this nagging feeling throughout the dev diaries and the whole game that royal court was some developer's gf/bf idea and they were very proud of it, so the dev had to put it into the game or sleep on the couch. How divorced royal court is from what the game actually needs (better economy, better warfare, better alliances, better diplomacy, etc.) it is as good an explanation as any.

                                                                     *****

There is just nothing major here: the cultural mechanics only imparts small differences and are pretty safe to ignore. Artifacts are ok, but it is not a major mechanical addition.

The most egregious thing is that after all this wait, half the people won't even get the courtroom or have to wait hundreds of years to do so. The idea that it would not be available for tribal leaders is just  ridiculous: playing as Hungary (one of the recommended starts) it takes centuries to become feudal because of the way that progression is set up. One can have an empire level title but still can't hold court? After 18 hours of play, the key selling feature of the DLC is still unavailable to my non-feudal empire. By the time I will eventually get to it, I doubt I will care at all. It is such a weird decision, it fits into the generally questionable mindset of Paradox perfectly.

Overall, it was a lot of build-up for a decisive dud. After all the anticipation, the DLC is thoroughly forgettable and is not a major addition to the game. Other Paradox games delivered a lot more for/with a lot less. Waiting almost an entire year with no content for this is just a let-down. This is the kind of DLC one would expect at the end of a game's life cycle: minor fluff to fill out some gaps, none that is essential to make the game better. As first DLC (and after all the hype) one could reasonably expect something significantly grander than this.

Coat of Arms designer is good, but it should have been a base game feature.

Also, not sure whether it is a DLC or Mod issue, but suddenly everyone is wearing turbans and random clothing which is both jarring and slightly amusing.

This feels like they delivered it to fulfil the DLC promise with as little work as possible either (a) saving anything more substantial for future paid DLC that will be out of the season pass most of the community got or (b) to sunset development on the game. How inconsequential the whole thing is, it really feels like an obligation they wanted to get out of, rather than any form of passion for developing the DLC.

A strong meh out of 10. Worth the wait? No. Worth the money? No. Would I buy it if I didn't already own it? No. So much about taking longer time to deliver larger DLC I guess.

-une cour panoramique en 2D modélisé en 3D qui ne sert a rien.
-Le système d'inventaire de CKII.
-Plus d'Évent via le bouton ""audience"".
-Un système d'upgrade ultra générique.
-Des items qui ne boost que vos stats.
-Une customisation de culture légère.

Tout ça dans le but de gonfler vos statistiques de prestige et dynastique et uniquement que pour les rois et les empereurs.

Et vous etes contents de ça ,30 boules pour Juste un boost pour les suzerains...
30 boules juste pour un mod (oui des mods faisait déja ça) payant qui ne change strictement rien au jeu ni ne rajoute rien.
Juste un boost de statistique...30 boules.

Vos arguments sont d'ailleurs complètement ... dingue.

-Les Pop-ups supplémentaires de la cour sont pour vous un gage de RP.
C'est juste des Pop-ups basiques d'événement lié à vos vassaux comme il y en a depuis CK1,ici il y a en a maintenant juste plus et ces sacrément fumer parceque tous les choix sont avantageux,soit vous recevez de l'argent,du prestige,de la piété en masse ou alors vous échangez un bon vassal contre un autre.
Et vous vous sentez RP uniquement a cause d'un texte qui décrit le popup ?
Prenez le mod VIET dans ce cas ! C'est gratuit en plus et il y a beaucoup plus de popups !

-Changement radicale de gameplay !
Vous avez fumé quoi les mecs ? En quoi vous jouez plus différemment qu'avant ? par quelle magie ? En quoi un foutu menu totalement esthétique et des pop-ups changent le gameplay ?
Vous vous êtes trompez de jeu ou quoi ?
Vous voulez vraiment un changement de gameplay ? QU'ILS FOUTENT LES HORDES ! 

-May ja lo chonjeman 2 multikulture !
AH,donc pouvoir crée sa propre culture pour avoir encore plus de statistique avec une série de cliques sur des images sa justifie pour vous 30 boules !?

-Mais je peux voir ma cour et mes objets en 3D ! 
Géniale,pour le prix d'un jeu neuf tu as une visualisation ultra-minimaliste et généraliste (avec bug) et qui na aucun impact sur le gameplay ou le jeu de manière générale d'une salle de trône (qui en plus se limite vraiment du strict minimum avec quasiment aucune diversité et qui se ressemblent quasiment toute).

Plus que jamais arrêtez de vous plaindre que tout va mal.
il est impossible de se plaindre que l'industrie du JV va mal quand on approuve les politiques qui font que ça va mal.
Vous vous mentez à vous-mêmes et vous encourager cette abomination.

Surtout qu'en ont sait que le studio est en ce moment en crise car il y a une enquête pour des rapports de harcèlement sexuel (pour forcer les devs à produire toujours plus en burnout y compris si la qualité est médiocre).
En acceptant cette d4ube vous cautionner ce qui se passe chez Paradox.

-Oui mais moi j'aime nanana !
Et alors,les baleines sur clash of clan et Fortnite adorent dépenser leurs salaires pour de la m4rd3,pourtant vous affirmez que ces scandaleux ! 
Ce n'est pas parce que vous etes des Golems sans âmes et en quête éternelle de rassurage et satisfaction personnel que le monde entier doit avoir vos gout pour la ch14sse.

Cette ""extention"" est une arnaque , un mod payant hors de prix pire que chez Bethesda.
Ok pour 5 Euros a la limite mais a 30,vous devez vraiment être le pire des PNJ pour supporter ça.

It is extremely overpriced for a few mechanics that are fun but get tedious very quickly. When waging a long term war, getting notifications about an inspired person, or the court, or even your artefacts breaking down gets tiring real fast.

I think I used the court for about 2 hours before getting bored- but it's cool that you can decorate the court room. It'd be better if it wouldn't scream at you with notifications but rather your Antiquarian did it automatically (maybe with a higher wage, or it cost you more monthly). 

The new roles at court are cool, it definitely gives a better role-play aspect which makes the game more enjoyable. I also had hoped for more cosmetics as the title ""Royal Court"" suggests new additions to the ruler's aesthetic as well as the court's aesthetic.

Merging cultures was something I was looking forward to, I was desperately trying to merge cultures but after about 7 hours I realised it won't benefit my culture in anyway. Maybe I need to try it again, but it seems minimally beneficial- maybe useful for multiplayer with people from different cultures?

I wish this expansion pack was better, at this point it feels on the same level as the Northern Lords pack... and wasn't that a flavour pack?

"1549","109916338","109916338","english","Just to be clear, I am a big fan of CK3 and it is the game I play most.
I was looking forward to the extension but must admit I am a bit disappointed.
Beside the price, which seems high for what the extension is actually adding, I expected, after all the hype put out there by the developers, a lot more.
The inventory is fine and a really nice addition. It does not seems to have yet the impact on the game play I would have expected but I accept that I may have expected too much and maybe the impact should not be that severe.
Traditions etc are maybe interesting but seem to me more an endgame feature as the requirements to be able make any changes (prestige) are very high. So until now I have not used it.
The one thing I really do not understand at all is that the ""throne room"" or ""royal court"" is not available to tribe based governments. There is no real logical reason for that. I am currently the King of Ireland and also holding about a third of England and Wales. But as I am still tribal I can not access the royal court. Do the developers think that a ruler on ""king"" level would not have decided on disputes or tried to display grandeur only because they were still in a tribal environment ? Even if only located in a long house or larger ""hut"" they would have. I just do not see the need for this restriction or even historical relevance if you like. So at the moment someone who likes to play on tribal level misses out on about half of the extension.
On another note, I do have the feeling that a few bugs have been introduced into the game that I have never encountered before. I went to battle with about 8000 men against 2500. The quality of the troops were even. I was winning and the opponent was down to about 400 men when suddenly the battle window shuts down and I was declared the looser of the battle with my about 6000 remaining troops running away from the 400 of my opponent. This happened all in all three times, but only after the royal court release. Also I ""swayed"" another character. I was successful, but instead of the relationship improving the character disliked me for 25 points more rather than less. Again this has not happened before since I have been playing the game (since its release). This looks a bit like a pattern, ie a minus sign in the wrong place of the code. 

The AI of allied troops still is really really bad. There seems to be no logic. Together with my allies I outnumber the enemy by 2:1 but my allies are standing around next to me not engaging while I get slaughtered. And it is even their war not mine ! 
Anyway this is something that has been around from the beginning... sigh.

All in all, not what I expected. Even taking covid into account it seems that it took too long to get out. I can not get away from the feeling that maybe the developers were starting off with features that sometime down the line proved difficult or even impossible to implement. Potentially part of the additions they wanted to introduce were scrapped or watered down in order to be able to release the extension at all. With this in mind I could see that covid may have had a real impact here. Especially in the design phase of a software project sketchy communication can bring about that the project goes down a rabbit hole and ends up in a dead end. Something that under normal circumstances would have been detected a lot earlier. To recover from that is difficult. 
Anyway, so all in all not great. I would hope that the developers use the fact that a lot of people are disappointed as a pointer and resolve any bugs asap and remove the arbitrary restriction of the throne room.
So my 'no' recommendation is to make sure that the developers take note that things are not as they should be or could have been.

I know you can't compare two, but the Northern Lords flavor pack was packed with content to the brim and was rated accordingly - mostly positive. For some reason this DLC, while adding not much in terms of content (and it is still far worse in quality than certain mods on Steam Workshop), Paradox put a 30$ price tag on this.  

Only feudal kings and emperors can hold court, so people like me, who like to start from a single county, can't enjoy the new mechanics until you get to the ""king"" status. It is weird. 

For me, CK3 is more about roleplaying and while this DLC claims to be focusing on roleplaying aspect of the game (more events, artifacts, and so on), it's not available from the start of the game and I personally think that's the problem. You, as the player, should be able to have ""Court"" as any lord of any tier, starting from count or tribal or whatever. Counts and Dukes had their own courts and at some points of history, those courts could be more grandeur than that of their liege's. And it most certainly would've improved the roleplay aspect of the game, cause you have these interactions and the progression of your court (from rags to riches) from the start of the game. (Remember the societies in CK2? Now imagine them locked behind duke tier or Learning stat or something like that) Like, we have events in the game where you, as a Viking lord, deal with disputes and stuff on ting-meets, but the ""Court"" mechanic is unavailable for you.  Who thought that was a good idea?

Artifacts are cool, nothing bad to say about them, except it would be nice, again, to have MORE control of your narrative. When I order a weapon to be made for my Viking king, I want it to be an axe, since he's an ""axe expert"" as was stated in the event. Instead, I have a 33% chance to make an axe, war hammer, mace, and else. Like, why can't I choose to make an axe, war hammer or mace is beyond me, apparently kings paid in advance for a cat in a bag. 

The Court Room 3D screen is nice, but again, you can't change the looks of the room, you just have some slots for court artifacts to put into, that's it. The player doesn't really have control of his own stuff and that's disappointing. The camera angles are locked so you can't really see who's petitioning you and the whole scene really looks not so alive, with characters frozen in place, without even an idle animation (imagine having an idle animation, isn't it something?).

What else do we have? Making hybrid cultures and divergent cultures is all about combining modifiers you like and choosing how your units look. It's okayish... but I guess it would be much to ask for something more deep and creative from a game development studio that spent almost a year developing this DLC and charges 30$ for it? Oh, I dunno. 

All in all, not much content, and the content we have is rather bland and unimaginative in my humble opinion. I paid for the deluxe or whatever version of CK3 that got me this DLC for ""free"", but the price they charge is rather high. 10$ - yeah, but the content here is worth 5$ and it is still too much. 

I really wanna love CK3 and Paradox and I was actually expecting them to make something good and of high quality, after 8 months this game went without any updated but if this DLC is a quality mark for the future, then I guess CK3 will never be better than CK2 and it sucks.",1644491309,1644491309,FALSE,6,0,"0.520780682563781738",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198007393646",245,42,0,0,NA,0

Interaktif ve tarihsel seriler için: https://www.twitch.tv/rockythegoodboy

8 aydir topluluk olarak dört gözle bekledigimiz bir DLC idi Royal Court. Her bir gelistirici günlügünü tercüme edip videolar halinde hafta hafta paylastim. Dolayisiyla bu paketin gelistirme asamasinda ne denli çetrefilli yollardan geçtigine tanik olmus ve oyunu toplamda Game Pass + Steam'de 1300 saati askin bir süre oynamis biriyim. Yani neden bahsettigimi biliyorum.

Okudugum kadariyla negatif yorumlarin büyük çogunlugu 30$/€'luk fiyata tepki gösteren yabanci arkadaslardan gelmis ki fiyat gerçekten çok yüksek ve anlasilabilir bir durum. Fakat Paradox'un oldum olasi is modeli bu. Oyunun vanilya halini binanin temeli olarak görüp, zamanla DLC'lerle insaati tamamliyorlar. Bu model benim de hosuma gitmiyor zira bir oyunu satin aldigimda tüm içeriklerine aninda erisebilmek isterim fakat Paradox bu sekilde çalisiyor ve bunu degistirmeleri  - yakin gelecekte - mümkünmüs gibi görünmüyor. Royal Court'un oyuna ekledigi 3D taht odasi yeniligi misal Paradox'un daha öncesinde hiç girmedigi bir toptu dolayisiyla bu süreçte ekibini büyütmesi gerekti ve bu da maliyete yansidi. 

Oyuna negatif Türkçe yorum atan arkadaslarsa gördügüm kadariyla Royal Court'un ne vaat ettigini tam olarak takip etmemis ve CK2'nin 8 yilda 72 DLC ile getirebildigi içerige RC sayesinde tek bir DLC ile ulasmayi beklemis arkadaslar. Yani TR'de olay abes bir sekilde CK2 vs CK3'e dönüyor hep. Bombos bir tartisma zira PDX is modelini degistirmedigi takdirde bu arkadaslarin CK4 çiktiginda da ayni kavgayi CK3 vs CK4 baglaminda sürdüreceklerini öngörmek için müneccim olmaya gerek yok. Esas meseleyi kaçiriyorlar. DLC'nin TR fiyati globalde 30$ iken bizde 50<U+20BA>, dolayisiyla TL'nin mevcut deger kaybini düsününce ne yazik ki pek sikayet edebilecegimiz bir durum degilmis gibi duruyor.

Royal Court ile ilgili sahsi yorumum ise su sekilde: Royal Court'a dair ne bekliyorsam karsimda buldum. Bir oyuncu ve bu oyunu globalde Twitch üzerinde en fazla yayinlamis içerik üretici olarak gelen içerigin vaat edilenden fazlasini sundugunu görmek beni çok mutlu etti. RC ile birlikte Paradox oyuna tonla yeni mekanik ekledi ve tüm bunlar ileride gelecek DLC'ler için oyunun mevcut temelini daha da saglamlastirdi. CK3 eksiklerine ragmen esi benzeri olmayan bir 4x RPG oyunu. Umarim gelecek DLC'ler için 8-9 ay beklemek zorunda kalmayiz zira bence negatif yorumlarin temelinde aslen insanlarin bu DLC'ye dair beklentilerinin içerik kurakligina bagli olarak sürreal seviyelere ulasmis olmasi yatiyor.

"1577","109914716","109914716","english","About the court itself:

You can't actually look around your court. You can't tell people where to stand. 
Displayable Court Artifacts have a few pre-designated spots with pre-designated pedestals; so no decorating your court as you like it.
They are also severely limited in number.
Holding Court is actually just a time-gated decision that gives you 3 mini-events in sequence.
Sometimes you get random little events that you have to open your court view for and click the person.

Not all of the court events even take you into the court but appear as a normal event window; such as when your vassals voluntarily decide to pay homage to you. In your court. Except it happens in a normal event window.
Several of the court events are just very obvious references to popular works or memes which atleast for me broke what little immersion the court itself provided.

It doesn't at all feel like YOUR court; it doesn't even feel like A court.
It feels like an ugly pre-rendered background that you can slap your war loot into.
This is made especially jarring by the beauty of the base game's main menu background images.
I feel like painted static backgrounds like the menu images would have been better, not to mention equally functional as there are maybe four camera angles you ever see your court from.

About the cultural system:

It's fairly simplistic and horribly unbalanced.
Most of the traditions don't tell you exactly what they do, so you have to look the numbers up.
You can't pick your balance of ethnicities for your new culture when hybridising. The game arbitrarily decides it.

Overall the DLC feels very unfinished.
The amount of content it provides is extremely limited.
As such the price is extremely high for what it provides.

I do not recommend buying it.
I personally only own it because I pre-ordered the CK3 version with it included.

At the time of writing the DLC content has lots of small to medium bugs and feels very untested.",1644489280,1644489331,FALSE,2,0,"0.525862038135528564",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197978336728",139,1,0,0,NA,0

Not corrupted, just gone. No save file, nothing. Just fucking gone. It's happened now, to me, 5 or 6 times and I'm just done with this. This DLC primarily adds an enormous amount of busy work. Some things are a lot easier, but it's not really worth the amount of new notifications. If, on top of that, you simply lose your Iron Man game every so often ...

Just, no.

At this price, nope. It's good. There are some good things here. However, it's very buggy and there isn't enough content. At this price, there's about 10% of the content you'd expect. Artefacts are a nice system, but in actual fact they aren't very good.  And they decay. And you need to spend money not only to repair them, but to have someone capable of repairing them. At this juncture, they are just a money sink - a means of addressing an imbalanced economy.

The courts are grossly limited. You can only be Feudal or Clan, you can only be a King or Emperor. The idea that Dukes can't have courts is not only silly, it's a-historical. 

It's just ... weak. It'd be a bit weak at $15, but it's very weak at $30.

It's a shame it's not available to everyone and no alternative is offered for tribals or dukes. Because having a Royal Court and holding court is a nice addition. Also the artifacts that you can place in your inventory or your court are nice. My first artifact was the skull of a local bandit lord. Which was subsequently inherited by my successors and has remained a permanent part of the court. That contributes to telling your family's story. I haven't really played with the adjustments to culture yet.

In terms of content, I think Royal Court is a good DLC. I bought this DLC as part of the Royal Edition. I understand that developing this DLC takes time and money, and maybe more than usual because of the 3D court. This translates into a higher price for the buyer. Whether that price is really justified for what you get is up to each individual to determine. But I can imagine that the fact that not every ruler has a Royal Court means that many people find the current purchase price too high.",1644487367,1644487367,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197972542981",352,8,0,0,NA,0

- j'ai rencontré un bug, il sera peut-être corrigé :
roi de serbie, vassal de l'empire byzantin : 2 cours, la mienne et celle de mon empereur. 
un événement a lieu dans la cours de mon empereur (j'ai demandé une audience et réclamé de l'aide pour augmenter le contrôle de mes comtés) mais le jeu m'envoie dans ma cours.
aucune action possible, pas possibilité de laisser un choix se faire automatiquement, le temps ne s'écoule plus. en clair : partie en ironman foutue, je n'ai plus qu'à recommencer et espérer que ça ne se reproduise plus... ou bien éviter d'être un roi vassal d'un empereur. 

Au bilan, 30 € pour potentiellement rencontrer un bug (je n'en ai pas rencontré d'autres, mais tout de même c'est limite de me faire payer 30€ pour un DLC pas testé correctement), et devoir monter en rang avant de profiter pleinement du DLC (j'aime bien démarrer au rang comte) le rend moins valuable que le DLC sur la culture nordique par exemple.

 attendez un peu avant d'acheter, il y aura peut-être un fix.

"1613","109911106","109911106","english","I prepurchased the Royal Edition of CK3, so essentially paid for this DLC before the base game was released.

There are a lot of negative reviews about the price - my take is:
a) The changes to the game make it a ""meaningful"" expansion (thinking back to CK2, where some DLC was really essential, others completely pointless);
b) A lot of these changes are available in the free Fleur-de-Lis Patch (patch notes: https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/ck3-dev-diary-89-1-5-0-fleur-de-lis-patch-notes.1509587/ );
c) Don't forget that the base game of CK3 included a lot of the best DLC features of CK2 from the beginning.

As for the changes themselves:
1. The Royal Court: Apart from 3D rendering of the court itself, displaying artifacts and (customisable) banners, the Hold Court Interaction adds RP elements through opt-in events, and can lead to a variety of in-game effects.
2. Cultural overhaul: Seems really detailed. Cultural traditions and ethos incentivise playing to your culture and hybridisation/divergence/reformation give longer term gameplay goals. Cultural men-at-arms are now tied to traditions, meaning you can hybridise to get longbowmen, catapharacts, horse archers, varangians and war elephants, if you really want.
3. Artifacts are back! Apart from some buffs and being able to display them in your court, you can buy claims on artifacts and scheme to steal them.
4. Minor court positions are back too.
5. Customisable banners are pretty neat - I wrote IKEA on the Swedish flag, for example.
6. Changing your realm/culture/religion's map colour is a nice touch.
7. Languages, meh, kind of just ties in with the cultural mechanics.

I'm really happy with this expansion, as you can probably tell. I'd recommend reading the patch notes and comparing the free/paid features if you are on the fence about buying it, though.",1644483624,1644483624,TRUE,53,1,"0.63058549165725708",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198083656300",275,9,0,0,NA,0

I believe an additional feature would've justified it fully, but I still feel that looking at it through the lense of almost a pseudo-""subscription service"" makes more sense. 

I say this because they offer free updates all the time -- the dueling, for instance -- along with the Northern Lords flavor pack (which I would argue is underpriced at only 6.99). I have no problem supporting a dev team with only $45 per year (assuming only 2 flavor packs, 1 expansion) for all the other content that's provided over the course of 12 months, instead of having to buy a new game that doesn't expand much for $60 every 1.5-2 years. 

Not to mention that that they made many features free in this update, i.e. the cultures, which is a huge feature to make available for everyone.

Es ist kein schlechter DLC, dass muss man schon sagen. Die Frage, die man sich aber stellen sollte, ist, ob das Gebotene mit dem Preis irgendwie zu rechtfertigen ist. Und ich denke, dass der Preis arg teuer ist. 
Positiv ist, dass der Thronraum ganz nett aussieht, alle 5 Jahre kann Hof gehalten werden (u.a. Vasallen werden eingeladen, es gibt Eventketten) und es gibt eine nette 3D Animation der Artefakte und des Thronaales bei statischer Kamera.

Die Artefakte kennt man aus CK2 und sieht hier ebenfalls gut umgesetzt. Sie können wieder angefertigt, erobert oder in Auftrag gegeben werden. Zudem besteht die Möglichkeit aus ihnen verschiedene Boni zu erhalten, wie erhöhte Prachtstufen, mehr Prestige etc.

- Cultures. Best part so far, really allows for customisation and language learning is nice immersive feature. But most of this feature came for free, making the actual dlc's price even harder to swallow. 

- Royal Court. A neat feature that is quickly forgotten about. Court events are a bit too rare and are rather repetitive, and there's no really no other reason to use the Court. Events such as Coronations, Weddings, Council Meetings and more would've really helped flesh out this feature and give it more reason to exist. The fact that tribal governments don't get one really restricts enjoyment of the previously fun Norse and Mongolian cultures. It would have also been nice for dukes and counts to receive a court, and there for to be graphic differences when court grandeur increases. 

- Artefacts. Neat but little more than modifiers in the end. Would've been nice if you could display more of them in the court. 

- Price. I would not recommend full price. In terms of content, Royal Court feels just as substantive as the far cheaper Northern Lords dlc. Don't do what I did, and just wait for this dlc to go on sale. 

Hopefully, in the future, Paradox can build on these royal court features but this dlc should've been more for its price.",1644479924,1644479924,FALSE,7,0,"0.513951420783996582",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198353214126",31,2,0,0,NA,0

A few hours of familiar gameplay in, it dawns on me, ""Oh right, the DLC! I should do DLC stuff"". So there I am, poking around in the game looking for DLC stuff to do. Hey, let's commission an artifact because that's a thing, right? So I click a few prompts, wait, and hooray, there's my shiny new whatever. I equip it then immediately forget all about it because its impact on the game is virtually meaningless. Next I decided to learn another language because that's a thing, right? So I dedicate 6 years of my character's miserable, gout-ridden life to learning another language, and hooray, I now know 2 languages. I think it applies a modifier somewhere because, you know, unseen math equations are fun. I immediately forget my character learned it because its impact is virtually meaningless. Then I look at the culture divergence only to see that it's a less interesting version of the core game's religion reformation mechanic. Yada yada, you see where this is going.

My review is simply: I fail to see the point.

New content is great, adds a lot of variety and customisation to the games. Compare it to last DLCs for EU4, now that's a scam. Saves are not working? They never worked before after new PATCH, not DLC. And there so much changes with basic mechanics for game so it's strange to except they would work.

Bugs, optimisation problems, balance issues? Yes, it' Paradox' bane. But they will iron it out. Mostly. But I didn't fine to much gamebreaking stuff. Again. EU 4, HOI4 are so much worse in this regard.

Price? I get this DLC for Royal Edition. Pretty good deal in my opinion. If you don't like the price, wait for sale.

Actually, it's kinda ""concept for this DLC is great, but it's kind of rough for now"" situation. If that's not good enough for you - wait for it to get fixed and price lowered on sale.

Firstly, the DLC has a pricetag of $30, which should be much cheaper. The price is unnecessary and doesn't fit for the content that it adds. The DLC content is good, but not worth the 30 dollars.

Next, the lack of royal courts is a problem. The purpose of the royal court DLC is to bring a court system to all of Europe, however these courts are limited to solely King and Emperor titles. There are no courts for Counts, Dukes, or Tribal nations, which all should have courts based on the time it took to make this DLC and how much was advertised. Not once in the process of advertising this DLC did I, the average consumer, notice that the Royal Court was not for Count or Duke titles. This information was really kept on the down low and my disappointment when I couldn't have a court as a duke was a lot. The mods that allows Duke's to have courts though are very poor because of the way the system is implemented, it allows for a single court language to dominate the map within 50 years for whatever reason, usually Greek, so those aren't any solutions to this problem.

You can view your royal court as a king rank or higher - but only if you are a kingdom or clan government. This should not be restricted - I want to see nomad khans in their tents gathering their kin and norse chiefs in their mead halls with their clans! Each major government would have had some form of 'court'.

Also - I would even argue that lower ranking can have a form of mundane meeting as well - greatly restricted, but could still call low borns or something.

Also, the rule where 'holding court' is restricted to 5 years. Why? - Why not give a major penalty if held within 5 years instead? - make it increasingly costly to hold court frequently - but it just seems arbitrary to take it away for 5 years.

Again, it feels weird - because it is good - but you won't get to see it unless you be very specific with the type of character/civilisation you play.

I feel like they are going to break up what should have been a fuller experience into two different DLCs because $$$$$$$$$$.

TL;DR - what is added is intriguing and unique, but the narrow application of it doesn't make it worth it.",1644471493,1644471493,FALSE,3,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198010681732",1600,90,0,0,NA,0

I mean the 3D court is cool for about 20 seconds (does anything actually happen in the 3D court? No), the culture stuff is an afterthought most of the time. 

The court, artifacts management and creation, minor titles and offices all add additional costs for players but this DLC and the patch offer very little in terms of a way to supplement income and that is all in conjunction with the nonsensical economy that existed in this game from launch (and CK2 as well to be fair) Hiring an bodyguard shouldn't cost half the entire monthly income of a county, hiring a physician shouldn't be 1/4 the price of building a brand new castle. So now the economy still makes no sense and there are easily 10-20 ducats of additional costs to be incurred for a mid tier court and a few minor titles.

The problem is readily apparent as well, most people even when complimenting RC lean heavily on the idea that this will be expanded on at some later time or that creative modders will have a field day both may be true but if those are the highest praise that can be offered then it reflects poorly on the product's individual merits currently.

The main feature of the DLC is the royal court a feature only available to Feudal or Clan Kings and Emperors which is honestly so baffling I can't believe anyone who actually plays CK regularly play-tested that and thought that it was a good idea ( so good luck if you want to play pagan tribes or anyone below King tier for an extended period maybe check back in 2-3 years)


Not sure what happened to Paradox between CK2 and CK3 but how you go from great expansions like Holy Fury and Monks and Mystics in CK2 to this is beyond me, its as if this DLC was made by people who haven't actually played CK at all they just had the game and its concepts described to them from a third party and then dove into developing new content blind.

The best bits of content that arrived with RC are ironically the things that previously existed in CK2 i.e Coat of Arms editor, Artifacts, and minor titles and importantly are included in the free patch.

This is also one of those DLCs that makes you question the competence of the devs working on it. Lots of the mechanics make very little sense, add tedious levels of micromanagement or are just extremely underwhelming/generic:

- Court Amenities get RESET/lowered on succession, which means when your character dies, for some reason your entire court just stops functioning: It goes from serving the best exotic meals to bread and soup in a matter of a day, everyone exchanges their fine garbs for peasant's attire, all the ""Endless servants"" disappear into thin air and your Grand lodgings get reverted back to shared bedrooms and straw mats. It also takes a long time to get your ""Court Grandeur"" back over time. WHY? No clue, I suppose this is their idea of balance, but it makes absolutely no sense and just means you have to do even more micro management on leader death. Speaking of which:

-The reset also applies to Court Positions, which there's many, many of now. you have to click through and find proper characters for each (with ""Aptitudes"" that aren't explained at all), and of course every character dies sooner or later, so you endlessly have to look for new ones. You don't even get notifications when those important Courtiers die. Micro is good and all, but not really fun when all you're doing is getting minor boosts for a few years and you have to keep eyes open in several different menus.

- Items/Artifacts are alright, but mostly the same generic stat sticks with very minor increases to secondary stats you'll barely need. Has some immersion/nonsensical issues which seems to be the theme of this DLC, with weird modifiers like ""+FERTILITY"" on gear like scepters, but compared to the other stuff this is the most serviceable, if underwhelming, feature

-The Culture options are all good, very similar to Religion, and add even more potential for modding. But the Prestige costs are EXTREMELY expensive for making custom changes with some strange prerequisites (like not having different culture on your borders, or locked behind late innovations), so until fairly late into the game you likely won't be able to customize much. 

-For whatever godforsaken reason, Courts (the main feature of the DLC) are not available to Tribal rulers or anything below King tier. This not only makes ZERO historical sense (Genghis Khan, Longhouses, family houses that have been a thing since neolithic times and at their prime 800years BEFORE the game starts), it also makes you miss out on a lot of the content that would help especially lower rank rulers immensely.
 This decision especially just baffled me at how this could get past any sort of testing or rationality. You'd think ANYONE working at Paradox with a hint of historical knowledge would immediately bat an eye at this, but nope. You don't get to sit down in a hall and rule your lands until you reform your religion, become feudal, and become King at least, which means the majority of starts won't have access to the main content until 100+ years into the game.

[hr][/hr]

Royal Court is a small DLC with very minor features in totality, which is strange as it was touted as the first major expansion for the game, and part of the Royal Edition, which I paid for. The aforementioned royal court mechanic is the main aspect of the DLC, which is effectively divided into two systems: grandeur and events. By having court, you receive three events, with petitioners asking you to decide between various decisions. Some of which, such as permitting a noble to pay [b]you[/b] for the privilege of constructing a barony, is imbalanced or broken. Occasionally your court, even when not in progress, will receive random events as well, requiring you to return to the court screen.

Personally I find this aggravating, as these events are really nothing different than the kind you'd get receive that pop up. Effectively, I have to constantly return to this screen, even when I have no other reason to, to see an event. This is a minor complaint of course, but I find that it interferes with the flow of the gameplay.

The second mechanic, grandeur, is basically just another minor mana system that benefits every avenue of your realm and family the more of it you have. Generally the best way to get it is to spend money on your court, or just to spend money on events. New and revamped court positions can also influence it, which I think is good. Artifacts can also modify the baseline rate of grandeur.

Speaking of artifacts, the system for it is robust and rather simple. You can choose to seek out an artisan to make you an artifact, at a worse quality, or wait until a notification about a traveling inspired guest happens. Always take the inspired guest, they make better artifacts for effectively the same if not more reasonable prices. Annoyingly, they seem to have crammed in the rivalry system a bit with the procurement of artifact, as I find that every artifact I commission seems to come with an event or two aggravating my Antiquarian or some person at court. To this affect, having good diplomacy helps.

The culture system seems interesting, but the paid aspect of it is relatively minor. Unless you are actively going for strange culture hybrids, or playing as a tribal or norseman, you will likely not find yourself using much of it unless you go out of your way since it comes with ridiculously high renown requirements to change something even as small as a tradition.

Ultimately, Royal Court really isn't that special of a DLC, especially after waiting so long for it. For the price they're asking, as a supposed 'major expansion' to CK3, it causes reasonable concern to wonder what the future path for this game looks like.  Even after some long delays, the actual released content is not that significant, and in many cases (such as the royal court itself!) feels like an actual paid mod.

Personally, as a Royal Edition owner, I find it upsetting since the expansion content we paid for is so far a small norse-flavor pack and now an overpriced new screen and culture mechanics that encourage meta-play.",1644462693,1644462858,FALSE,3,0,"0.519324123859405518",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198071623135",228,5,0,0,NA,0

The bonuses for artifacts and court levels aren’t that game changing, and I can see strategists feeling like they need to do every interaction to squeeze out some extra renown or gold. Courts also don’t work at duke level unless you play mods. There's also the ability to reform your culture or even combine cultures. For example,  in one game I became half Norse-half Scottish as Ivar the Boneless. This is a cool feature but IMHO not as interesting as reforming religions. 

So in summary, I highly recommend if you want to feel more invested in your characters. If you’re playing this as a medieval war game it’s not worth the price.",1644461304,1644551962,TRUE,1,0,"0.504493653774261475",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198002605304",363,4,0,0,NA,0

Royal Court is a fantastic addition to an already-packed CK3 experience, presenting huge roleplaying opportunities and enhancing the overall experience. Heck, the artifacts help increase renown which will make it loads easier to disinherit your kids :D 

The culture rework is nothing short of fantastic. I've managed to create my own Middlehavet culture, mixing Greek with Norse, enabling me to easily rule over the Byzantine Empire as Emperor Ragnarr I Haesteinnian. 

The Hold Court mechanic is pretty cool, and though the effects aren't that profound, they simply let you do more stuff aside from the standard CK3 experience. The best part about it is you can see your characters and family members, brought to life.

I feel like the artifact system could be further fleshed out so you have something to do with all the excess items you end up hoarding, but it is a good start. The system of diverging and hybrid cultures is really cool, as it adds replayability to different parts of the world other than just genociding everyone into your culture each campaign. The languages are also cool but I think the court language feature could be more developed. One last thing that I really enjoyed was the new music tracks. For the last couple hundred hours of playing CK3 I've had podcasts on in the background, but these new medieval tunes have actually gotten me to turn the audio on again.

"1746","109897427","109897427","english","[B][U]Overall, I'd say the DLC and accompanying free patch is great but not perfect - massive, thoughtful, fun content, especially for roleplayers, but some issues here and there.[/U][/B] The scope of a lot of the content is not readily apparent from a superficial glance, and is under the hood or will only be encountered after either playing a lot or looking in the code directly. For context, I am speaking mainly from the PoV as a roleplayer who hates minmaxing.

The culture rework is ambitious and while wonky in a few places (such as debatable choices for some culture's traditions and ethoses) a good step in revolutionizing cultures to be more dynamic compared to previous GSG games. Ethoses are boring and might border on stereotypical/pop history, but traditions are where the new additions shine - for both roleplayers and minmaxers, there's a lot of stuff that's offered in finding interesting traditions to take advantage of. Languages are cool flavor as well, and reflect an aspect of history not often seen in strategy games.

Artifacts are perhaps the funnest part of the expansion to me. There's a lot of stuff that can happen to them behind the scenes, and they're more dynamic than their CK2 counterparts from both a gameplay perspective and how they're coded.

New events and decisions are also fun and nice for roleplay, and always welcome.

The big letdown for me is 3D courts which, while nice and definitely something the devs put a lot of time and love into, are underwhelming to me from a roleplay PoV - it's nice to see my characters, sure, but it feels like a side distraction that's disjointed from the game, and a glorified variation of the event window at times. Hopefully it will be improved on in the future.

[B][U]TLDR: All in all, a solid 8/10 DLC giving CK3 much needed life especially as a roleplayer, that expands flavor and gameplay for all parts of the map in a well-integrated manner, though not without its issues.[/U][/B] As to whether it's worth your money, I will hesitantly say yes, given how much content is offered, but I can absolutely understand if others see the price as too high.",1644459287,1644470899,TRUE,6,0,"0.593187928199768066",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198030765209",118,13,0,0,NA,0
"1747","109897403","109897403","english","CK3 Royal Court is a decent DLC, but not worth 30€. While nothing is wrong with any of the new court mechanics they also aren't that great that they earn the price tag. Let's go into detail.

Mechanically you pay for the ability to hybridise and diverge cultures and for the court system itself. I will mostly focus on the core of the DLC, the court, but acknowledge that the new culture system is great. 

Mechanics

The court system is a way for non-tribal emperors and kings to tunnel some of that high gold income in to other avenues like prestige or renown and to incur some other benefits. Each court has a court type, court language and amenities, four sliders with five steps each that influence your base glamour and each have different benefits. Glamour is basically your court level and the higher it is, the more benefits you unlock. Court types are influenced by your culture type and also confer various benefits depending on your glamour level. Court language also affects glamour and in the case of less powerful courts and kingdoms, it may behoof themselves in adopting the language of a more powerful court/country.

You can hold court and court event can happen. Holding court gives you three events which can give you some boons or drawbacks. Beyond that you can get petitioned by vassals or as a vassal petition yourself. Once a liege, a vassal can also present themselves to court, giving the liege renown and the vassal other bonuses as well.

Then there are the artifacts. You can commission artifacts, like tapestries, weapons or even books to wear or showcase in the court. These also give beneifts, mostly in the form of prestige and glamour. They generally have durability and you need to repaired them every so often. While the general artifact system is free, to use those showcased in the court you need the DLC.

Lastly, there are court positions, similar to the minor titles in CK2. These are free of charge and include your Court Physician and others. Having the Royal Court DLC enables certain special roles for kings and emperors, like a Seneshal that speeds up construction, or a food taster that can save your life at the risk of said taster being in cahoots with plotters. The largest issue with these is that there are a lot of positions and when you play at higher speeds position holders tend to die away. There is pop up, but depending on what you are doing it's a flash in the pan and you miss it.

Visuals

I'll be frank, the visuals of the DLC are lacking. The court culture types are nice, what exists is well modeled, however I question why the court rooms were included in the first place. What you see in the screenshots is what you get. Courtiers standing still, some in new idle poses, doing nothing, while your displayed artifacts are lovelessly being shown in the room. If they are in the capital your character sits on the large seat, while their (first) spouse sits left next to them. Women for some reason kneel im most cultures, looking like they are doing penance or going to confession, but this is not the primary issue. 

The primary issue is that there is no dynamism. Regardless of how much money you invest in the court, visually it stays the same. A court with no amenities looks the same as a court with every amenity under the sun. One amenity you can invest in is fashion, however beyond the numerical bonuses your court won't change their attire. This goes further. The game now forces you to open the court view to do certain events, however beyond involved characters being in certain idle animations there is no reason to open the window. The court itself doesn't even react to the scenes. The events are still dealt with in an event window and with a lot of events you will need to leave the view to find a title or character. Finally, there is the camera. It is locked to three different angles by default with events moving the camera around a bit, but nothing more.

After having looked at the different cultural courts and the initial court events there is nothing there to keep the player coming back. Even roleplayers will not be satisfied. Did their grand vision for the DLC not work out? I don't know, I can only critique something that is there.",1644459243,1644498595,FALSE,0,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198069182869",209,2,0,0,NA,0

Pro
- Das neue Kultur System ist gut wenn auch absurd teuer ingame. 
- Der Hof ist angenehm gestaltet und erfüllt die neuen RPG Elemente sehr gut. 
- Boni von Artefakten sind gut umgesetzt und weder overpowered noch nutzlos. 
- Gerade im Kultur Bereich lässt sich nun auch eine eigene Kultur erstellen. Sehr gut. 

Cons
- Platzhalter und fehlende Übersetzung. 
- Das 3D Modell des Hofs ist zwar nett anzusehen aber weder eine zoom Funktion noch eine freie Kamera drücken die Stimmung extrem.
- Der Hof wird schnell repetitiv und langweilig. (Ständige Wiederholung der selben Abläufe) 
- Fehlende Mechaniken für den nett anzusehenden Hof lassen ihn schnell als nutzlos erscheinen lediglich die Boni sind gut. 
- Nur Könige oder Kaiser können einen aktiven Hof haben was irgendwie schlecht durchdacht wirkt und historisch völlig falsch ist. 
- Gerade Hof Mechaniken die mehr Spieltiefe bieten sucht man vergeblich. Sehr schade. 
- Es ist nicht wirklich ersichtlich wozu man diverse Hof Posten überhaupt benötigt oder ob man diese Posten besetzen sollte. Manche Posten wirken abseits von Kosten völlig nutzlos.  
- Gerade das Hof halten fühlt sich wie eine Dauerschleife von Events an die sich wiederholen und sehr schnell nerven anstatt dem Spieler mehr Spieltiefe zu geben. 

Alles in allem ist das keine 30€ Wert auch wenn ich weiß das da sehr viel Arbeit eingeflossen ist muss da mit Patches einfach mehr kommen und mehr Spieltiefe etabliert werden. Sollte sich das in Zukunft ändern werde ich auch die Rezension abändern und neu bewerten. 

Kaufempfehlung für 10 bis 15€ aber nicht darüber hinaus. Wer warten kann sollte das auch tun.

"1777","109894596","109894596","english","Everyone is a critic. I like this expansion.

Paradox is frequently criticized for DLC being too expensive. I don't know what to say to that. I have 250+ hours played of Crusader Kings III. Much of that is from the baseline game. I didn't get Northern Lords until recently. With this expansion, I will likely play at least another 100 hours. So between $2.50 - $3.80 per hour played. Seems like a good value to me. 

I like this expansion because it adds a vital element to Crusader Kings: something to do other than paint the map. A big learning curve for new CK players is telling them it's ok if nothing happens for months, years, or decades. Sometimes your realm is doing ok and you're just riding the wave baby. With Royal Court, there's always something happening. It's not always important. Sometimes it's trivial and easy to ignore, but there's something going on.

I played Crusader Kings for the role playing element of the game and Royal Court adds to that. To me, this is an essential DLC. More than that, I want Paradox to make more DLC like this. I don't care to play as the tribal north, or in other regions with other stuff going on like India... well maybe idk I would I don't actually know... but if it were up to me I'd ask for a deeper more role-playing orientated improvement to the classic Europe game I already love. 

If I have a gripe with Royal Court, it's the repetition of certain scenarios. I've played it for maybe 8-12 hours and I keep getting new issues at court, so that's a sign there's a lot of content. However, I've had maybe 5 physicians steal bodies from the local cemetery. It's silly to see that same issue happen to every ruler, sometimes multiple times, with the same physician. I think they could add more of those.

I also think the user interface is a little clunky when considering other things within the Royal Court view. For example, i'll get a dilemma like Joe from Town A and Bill from Town B are disputing, but it's not easy for me to look at Towns A and B without completely Xing out of the entire interface. I don't exactly remember all the towns in my domain.

Otherwise, I wish there was a Royal Court interface for lower lords. If I'm a count or a duke, can I make asks of the King every now and then? Or can I hold my own court for lower-rank issues? That seems vital. The game should be fun at all stages, not just kings and emperors imo.

Anyway, I'm happy with it.",1644454685,1644454685,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197991441485",371,68,0,0,NA,0

"1802","109892459","109892459","english","when i first seen the dev daily, I know it would be pretty weak and it did not disappoint. the main problem i have with this DLC it too much focus on roleplay and would be fine in any other game but you just cant make a event focus DLC for a game you going put over 100 + hours in. in one game i was seeing events i already seen before which isn't good when it all it got.

for even getting access to the dlc you need to be at least king rank so like 70% the starts cant use it at start and if you like playing small you have even less starts. now the courts how do they look? well not bad but am not a historian so i cant say how accurate it is. i wish they added a way to customise you cant change actual look of it that tied to culture. for the mechanics of the court well you can set the spending of the court on things like food housing servants and outfits.

none of these actually do anything visibly its just modifiers and by mid way point in a game you just max them all it because there not much reason not to and the higher it is the more Court Grandeur which is kinda like a currency? as you can use it for events
but court grandeur is the level of your court the higher it the more modifiers you get depending on your court type there 5 base on all the stats Diplomacy, Martial, Stewardship and Learning but you culture will need to have the right ethos to pick them.

you will also get 2 decisions. 1 hold court basically ever 5 years you can hit a button and get 3 people come to your court and tell you their problems and you can pick what to do. 70% of the time these are irrelevant like gay lovers in the court, peasants being unhappy with your vassals and a 4 year old come half way across the world asking for you to press his claim. you can pick options base on what stats you have or what every you find the best or the funniest. 

for the 2nd one well you get to hire people to make or find a artifacts and depending on how skill they are or how much money you throw at it like 80% of the time your throwing your money away but maybe you get a cool knife these are mostly modifiers and even then the visible ones are in a box a pile of gold or only show up in specials events like battle or duals for weapons. 

artifacts are not part of the dlc but court artifacts are.

of the models themselves they're pretty bad, looks like something you would buy from the unity store. I got a throne made and the base one look better and the throne wasn't even in my court style, for the really good artifacts you need to steal them our get luck with one of those people finding one so good luck because everyone i got died or got lost. late game you will spammed with people late game with Inspirations asking for money to make artifacts.

they also added court positions which are just jobs in the court that gives bonus to you at the cost of gold the dlc as some but most are part of the free update

next is customisable cultures well there not much to say it kinda like religion but much slower to change. you need to be the head of the culture to do it so F to people who like to play small and also have like 1000s of prestige and then you can choose to change something this part is part of the free update. the next part you need royal court for

you can make a New culture or Hybrid cultures which sticks parts of them together and you can pick that takes Cultural Acceptance. it pretty fun and adds flavour but it takes so long and cost so much it not something that you will be intertacting with alot.

at the end of the day this DLC adds flavour but when the basic game cant really show off those flavours with mechanics it just comes down to a text box simulator where i need to make believe because the basic game is so weak and the fact they needed to delay this makes me really question where are these DLC going?",1644451080,1644481752,FALSE,5,1,"0.522220790386199951",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198237524280",110,2,0,0,NA,0

Lots of work went into this update to develop a bunch of features and those features had to be split between the free update and the paid DLC. All the most important stuff ended up in the free update which is part of the reason why many people say there isn't enough in the DLC. 

A big problem with CK2 was that all the features were in the DLC and that caused a huge mess when other later features had to work with any combination of DLC (or more likely just kind of didn't work without all the required DLC). Royal Court shows Paradox is doing better and actually prioritizing long term health and stability of the game over a quick buck.

"1807","109892069","109892069","english","Royal Court is a strong contender for the best expansion Paradox has ever released. The systems included in it are deep and engaging both for min-maxers and role-players. The new culture mechanics are the best system for representing cultural practices in any strategy game I've ever played. They allow for change, divergence, and hybridization to happen dynamically and to actually matter, with tangible benefits.

The Royal Court itself is the single most ambitious system Paradox has ever added to any game. While some lesser expansions of other titles can be accused of simply adding more modifiers, the court adds a stage for the drama of intrigue and diplomacy to play out in. Both literally, thanks to the physical representation of the space itself, and metaphorically insofar as it allows for a host of new interactions.

Finally, the artifact system is back from CK2 but is both far better balanced, better integrated with other systems (you can display artifacts in your court), and is just generally more interesting.

I think there are only two complaints I have so far: 1) the price is high, and 2) there are a few bugs.

I personally think the price is reasonable for what this is: a content rich and systemically sophisticated expansion. It is priced similarly to a full Civ V or VI expansion, and it feels like it adds as much or more to the game. That being said, for Paradox fans used to the level of content typically on offer in a new Paradox expansion, I think the price clearly is raising some red flags for people. Rest assured, this expansion is well worth the money.

As for the bugs, I suspect they will be ironed out fairly quickly. I haven't experienced anything game breaking, but something is wrong with the 3d models for characters (they all look a bit uncanny) and I've had some faction formation notifications coming up way too often (once every few days). These are ultimately annoying but don't ruin the experience. But I was hoping for a slightly smoother experience given how long this has been in development.

Overall, I highly recommend the Royal Court to anyone who enjoys CK3 and wants a deeper experience. I don't think you will be disappointed if you can get past the high price tag.",1644450462,1644450462,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198029583351",350,2,0,0,NA,0

Problem is the main update with its cultures is amazing and its for free.
This update is amazing and once again it is for free. 
But thats not enoug there is also artifacts and an inventory, also for free as long as you dont need the grandeur stuff.

However the royal courts itself is meeeeeeh.

The mechanic itself is amazing. Displaying your spoils of war is great. The mechanics in itsefl are great. However the highest level of grandeur is so easily achieved that every normal king is in a matter of one decade on level 10.
Reforming my culture takes 40 years, which seems adequately but becoming the most famoust court takes merely some few years.

So guys after a short rant. The free patch is amazing and the idea of the DLC is cool. However 30€ for some more flavour is a bit too high, unfortunately when it comes to it, it is just a bit  more flavour.

"1833","109880056","109880056","english","I rarely do reviews and when I do it's typically just a joke but this dlc is the only joke that needs to be seen. There were so many possibilities that could have come with this dlc but paradox has dropped the ball once again with an outrageous price for a VERY minor dlc. For $30 you get a 3D royal court to 'interact' with, an overhaul to cultures, more court positions, and a new artifact system. Now at first you might think you are getting what amounts to a complete overhaul considering this is $30. No, you will be getting a 3D courtroom (only if you are a kingdom or empire) that is extremely bland, an artifact system that is decent but arbitrary, and a nice culture rework. None of this is worth $30, nothing it adds is necessary to the game and most importantly, the focus of the dlc seemed to be building a 3D space that is quite honestly subpar. The events that happen in your court can range anywhere from decent to straight up bad. There will be times where somebody will come to your court, make their plea, and your choices are bad, really bad, and really really bad. The over 20 court positions have about 5 useful ones while the rest are fluff, your throne room is a bunch of 3D models standing completely still while occasionally looking around or swinging their arms with generic crowd noise in the background. When you hold court it is more or less the same as dilemmas the only difference is now your camera is in the throne room which again, doesn't move or have voice acting. Now credit where credit is due, the culture overhaul is very nice. There are around 6 ethos that set up the base of your culture and around 70 traditions to select from, it is a very nice system to set up some long term goals but there isn't much more to it. Overall I feel this dlc was an extreme overuse of resources for something that nobody was really asking for, a 3D court is nice but not at the cost of all substance in the dlc. $30 for what this dlc offers is ludicrous and really goes to show how paradox plans to put as little effort in with as large of a price-point that they can get away with.",1644447190,1644447190,FALSE,2,0,"0.523809552192687988",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198026634360",152,4,0,0,NA,0

Game for the most part plays out the same except there are new mechanics connected to artifacts, culture, and the ability to have a 3D model of a throne room. The new culture mechanics are nice because they add way more flavor to how they work, instead of just forcing your entire region into your culture type, you can merge cultures together to get the best bonuses of said cultures. You can diverge away from your culture into a new one or reform your already existing one. The artifacts are a nice feature but CK2 had artifacts too, this isn't a new feature but a pre-existing one imported from CK2. The throne room feels like a gimmick. It honestly feels boring and if it wasn't for the artifact/furniture slots in the throne room to give bonuses, it feels like a massive waste of time. It adds flavor to the roleplay prespective but definitely doesnt add jack to the gameplay. If the dlc was worth $20 I would recommend it but $30 feels way too steep, even by Paradox's reputation. $30 for some new mechanics but I would have rather sunk the $30 into something else.

Idk man the DLC and the patch features have totally overhauled the game for me. And I assumed it would have landed well with fans who always express frustration at the fact some CK2 DLC features didn't make it into base CK3, but hey with the first DLC and patch paradox have brought back artefacts (which was at least 50% of Monks and Mystics DLC), overhauled culture in a way akin to how pagan religions were overhauled by Holy Fury and implemented what was the customisation add on for CK2. And it was all implemented in a much better way than any of those were in CK2.

So yeh at the very least 1.5-2 DLCs worth of content. In my opinion anyway!

"1845","109879432","109879432","english","So far I have completed one campaign and here are my thoughts thus far. I really like a lot of the mechanics added such as the new dynamic culture system and the 3D court. However, I have issues when it comes to content based around them. 

On Culture:
I played as Duke William in 1066 with the idea that blending cultures of Anglo-Saxon and Norman would be an interesting path. However I found that once winning the war and moving my capitol to London I got the old decision to form English Culture. From my basic understanding it would be disadvantageous to build cultural acceptance and form my own convergent culture with Anglo-Saxon based solely on the time required to do so. That leaves me with questions: 

Why does this event not require any cultural acceptance or any new requirements for that matter? 
Why does this event exist the way it does?
 Where is the roleplaying of moving your capital and on the same day form a new culture?

 It would be nice if this event instead of bypassing the new DLC it would embrace it and incorporate it. A suggestion I would have is to require the same level of cultural acceptance to take the decision. The one nice portion is that English Culture does get new Ethos in Longbows.

3D Courts:
I am sad to say that it is an absolute performance nightmare. I have a 2080s, but still would be maxing out my GPU and hitting temps of upwards of 80C whereas I would normally only get to ~60-70C pre-DLC. This point will probably be irrelevant as new patches come out improving performance (hopefully). 

Finding out that nomads/tribals don't have a court is just sad. I was hoping to play a Viking raider holding a court in a wooden hut surrounded by the great artifacts I have conquered from around the world (Speaking of artifacts they feel so small and insignificant in the court). 

Overall I think the DLC is average to good with lots of potential left on the table (for mods to pick up at this point). While I wish Steam would allow more nuanced scores rather than yes/no I feel like my voice will only be heard by developers if I highlight the aspects that were disappointing.

"1846","109879427","109879427","german","Ich habe das DLC von einem Freund geschenkt bekommen, deswegen ist es für mich schwierig im Bereich des Preises vom DLC einzugehen. Jedoch kann ich auf jeden Fall sagen, dass das DLC seinen Preis nicht wert ist. Wenn man es für unter 20 Euro bekommt, ist das eine andere Geschichte.

Die Gameplay features finde ich aber schon echt cool gemacht. Wenn ich meinen Hof halte und ich auf die Probleme meiner Vasallen eingehe, sehe wie sie sich vor mich verbeugen, dann fühlt sich das schon wirklich immersive an. Finde aber ein wenig schade, dass die Artefakte teilweise sehr lame im Raum plaziert werden. Vor allem bei Waffen ist mir dies aufgefallen, da dann wenn man ein Schwert in seinem Hof ausstellt in der Mitte des Raumes einfach ein Waffenständer mit der Waffe drauf steh und das ist schon sehr unbefriedigend. Ich wünschte mir in dem Bereich, dass man Waffen an die Wand und dann vielleicht auch mehrere Waffen auf einem Slot hängen könnte.

Dann finde ich auch schade, dass man die Ausrüstung, welche man in seinem Inventar trägt nicht optisch an seinem Charakter sieht. Das einzige was sich hier ändert sind die Stats, was sehr enttäuschend ist. In Crusader Kings 2 hat man auch z.b. die eigenen Kronen gesehen, die man gebaut hat.

Sonst ist der Rest meiner Meinung nach echt gut gemacht. Es macht finde ich bisher Spaß ein Hof zu halten, es macht Spaß sich mit den Kulturen auseinanderzusetzen, vor allem wenn man ein Großreich hat mit vielen verschiedenen Kulturen und Sprachen. Diese Tiefe hat das Spiel nach 1 Jahr ohne zugefügtem Content auf jeden Fall gebraucht, deshalb lohn sich das DLC meiner Meinung nach auch.

Was ich auf jeden Fall noch erwähnen muss ist, dass endlich das Kriegssystem ein komplettes Rework braucht. CK hat bei weitem das schlechteste Kriegssystem von allen Paradoxspielen und dazu auch das langweiligste und das nervigste, da Kriege einfach nur sehr repetitiv und grindy sind.

There is no point in dwelling on the fact that this expansion is receiving mixed / negative attention.

The issue with this ""expansion"" is within these two points (in my opinion),

1. Its price - Its too expensive for what you get
2. Paradox's format for CK3 content, or lack of

Too call this an expansion is a bit of a joke, and for A$ 42.95 (or someone who has also purchased the season pass way back when) does leave a bitter taste in my mouth.

Yes the court system is an interesting and fun concept, but its fluff - it barely changes ANYTHING within the base game, my main concern is that if Paradox thinks that if this is appropriate for expanding CK3 then we they really need to have take a look at them selves and maybe find another job. The viking addon content was cheaper, and although also lacking was far more appropriately priced.

Yeah, $30 is high for a DLC, especially when a lot of the coolest content came via the free patch that went live alongside this. However, $40 was a steal for the base game before the free patch, and now I'd consider that ridiculously low for what you're getting. You can't criticize the devs for making a money grab here when they've already provided tons of content into the base game.

I'm not positive which of the features came free and which were part of this DLC, but the rework of cultures is absolutely game-changing. If you're a fan of putting yourself in weird situations (like taking a Viking clan to India), this addition makes that playthrough totally viable and very immersive. The artifacts mechanic is as much fun as it was in CK2, and the royal court feature is neat (in my opinion not as nice as artifacts or cultures, and still a tad buggy, but an interesting feature nonetheless). Certainly makes the mid- and late-game less tedious.

First off I want to say good work paradox, despite some minor bugs I'm sure you will squash in the first update beyond this release, the dlc is everything I expected and more. Crusader Kings has easily become one of my favourite games and this adds so much to my playthroughs, my first adventure began with a custom character of Frisian culture (my own heritage) and quickly took over the kingdom of Frisia, though I have done this before.
This time however it was about 10x more fun with the introduction of my very own royal court! The Vikings are giving me an absolute battle for my life on my coastlines and the Karlings are swirling about Europe as usual. What makes this playthrough different with the dlc is my plans to adopt the things that make Norse so great into Frisian, and the roleplaying aspect of this run has been extremely fulfilling.

"1935","109873993","109873993","english","The content itself is basically fine, but it doesn’t solve much about the base game being very easy and extremely bereft of things to do. Also you should note that if you start as a Count or a Duke, the royal court feature only becomes available at the King or Emperor level. This means the vast majority of available characters to play won’t have any interaction with the DLC at all. And by the time you’ve hit king or Emperor you’ve basically already “won” so this becomes a victory lap simulator.
Unfortunately it’s just more bonus stacking. Everything you do merely adds more meaningless positive modifiers. 
Here’s an example: I’m playing Basil I in 867. I get a pop-up that someone has an inspiration to craft a piece of jewelry. A few events later and I have some kind of brooch. All that clicking and reading for…+.22 prestige per month? Nothing against the writing, which is clever, but the rewards just don’t seem that commensurate with the input requirements, which frequently involves years worth of income. The crafting events repeat as well in future projects (this was a problem in Holy Fury too), so I had to admonish my wife repeatedly to avoid her ruining my chances of a good item. Which I guess is exactly the sort of wacky meme stuff they’re setting out to do with this game now.
On a technical level the royal court itself is very laggy, any camera movement will result in choppiness and stuttering. The lighting is also bizarre, most of the characters look like they’re glowing in my gloomy castle. 
So no pop system, no economy, not much to do in the way of realm management, and the new culture system is part of the free update. $30 gets you something that makes the game run worse and will make you notice immediately how small the event pool still is.

HOWEVER, I am not recommending Royal Court due to its outrageous price tag for the amount of content and too narrow a scope for its price tag. Why do only Emperors and Kings get a court? Dukes and Counts should also have courts (albeit a smaller scale appropriate to their station). There are too few court styles. Why, having just had a Northern Lords Norse flavour pack, is there not a Norse themed throne room for owners of that pack?

The amount of time and money spent on the 3D court, while cool, isn't worth it from a game play perspective. The throne room is static, nothing cool happens there with its static view and ridiculously easy grandeur level progression. When you hold a feast, there's not even a different view, signalling a grand event is happening at your court right now! Courtiers standing in random areas, limited atmosphere...all for what? $33 CAD and a couple small buffs via items?

Plus the content in the accompanying free update which includes a pretty major rework of how culture works. It's nothing mindblowing, but they are features you're going to see and use regularly throughout the game, so I wouldn't say it's small stuff. It adds a lot of flavor and many mechanics as well.

If you play CK3 like you would EU4, with little regard for roleplay, then this DLC might not be for you. I mean, it does provide useful mechanics and whatnot, but I think it is mostly a boon for RP'ers. It really brings your court and realm to life, and you no longer view those things as just borders on a map. The cultural mechanics are also great if you're not so RP inclined (though they still cater to RP'ers), they're kind of like an improved religion mechanic, and add a lot more depth to the game. I can say the same for the new inventory system as well.

Is the price high? Yeah. Is it reasonable compared to other Paradox games, yeah I'd say so. It is substantially larger than most other expansions, and CK3 DLCs come out much more infrequently (this has been in the works for what, 1.5 years?). Now, is Paradox's DLC policy in general unreasonable? Maybe, I'm not sure, but I don't blame you if you think it is. I just don't agree with the reviews which are comparing this expansion's price to the expansion price pertaining to titles from games like EU4 or HOI4.

Longer Review -

Positives:
Better cultural depictions,
Fleshes out diplomacy more with new modifiers and negatives,
Cultures now have more depth to them and changing them is possible, allowing for more customized gameplay,
Vassalizing foreign culture and religion rulers is now viable,
Court artifacts and grandeur allow for easier control of vassals and make playing a King or Emperor feel better than a Duke,
New Councilor interactions and new court roles!,
Since diplomatic rule is now possible, it feels like a new side to the game beyond being a simple warlord,

Neutrals:
Running the court can feel like a chore sometimes but gives a deeper sense of rulership beyond rebellions, vassal management and wars,
Peacetime is more interesting with court stuff occupying your time but it takes more time and isnt what some people like,

Negatives:
Not completely balanced yet, gold income hasnt changed but courts require more gold upkeep,
Some areas of the map are more interesting than others still,
Long development time means people are angry with the developer,
No tribal royal courts which is really inaccurate and you feel the absence of them,
The developer kill off other games to make this including Imperator may it RIP!

"2003","109869420","109869420","english","TL;DR: This expansion adds new systems and mechanics that improve role-playing and make managing a large empire significantly more complex and interesting. Recommended for roleplayers and for experienced players looking for replay value.

Overall, this expansion succeeds in making prestige and gold more valuable and useful than in the base game, tying the former into the new grandeur system and using the latter to fund inspirations and pay for court expenditures. Growing your court alongside your empire will be much more engaging, and the new cultural mechanics make managing a large empire much more interesting and dynamic. Highly recommended for anyone looking for more mechanics to consider, deeper roleplaying, or more interesting large-domain management.

The Throne Room:
-Represents the characters and court in a grounded, physical way unlike anything in previous paradox games. The individual interactions displayed here greatly improve immersion and the role-playing of interacting with your vassals.
-Seeing your character in a 3D space, surrounded by symbols of your wealth and power, shifts the feeling of the game from playing as a nation and map-painting like many other paradox games and reinforces the unique status of CK3 as a medieval roleplaying experience.
-Holding court adds context to many of the events you might see in the base game, while adding many, many more events for a player to experience. After seeing most of the events the base game has to offer, these new interactions significantly improve replayability.
-Court positions make paying attention to the skills of guests more important, and tie together with plots, warfare, and court mechanics well.

Cultural mechanics:
-Cultures finally have mechanics for dynamic growth and emergence, making culture as important and flexible as the base game's religion system
-Language and cultural heritage add depth to cultural differences. These build on the existing culture group system to create a much more dynamic system for the internal conflicts of large, multicultural empires.
-When growing a small duchy to a powerful empire, you now have the option to facilitate the growth and divergence of your culture, rather than painting the map with a single culture (looking at you, Andalusian)
-Cultural uprisings now have more context and feel like a reactive part of your interactions with your subjects, rather than just a mob of peasants

Artifacts and Equipment:
-The least interesting part of the update, somewhat awkward, but ties in well to the court system. Overall an improvement from CK2's implementation, but barely.
-Event chains from adventurers and craftsmen are engaging and interesting, and can spice up an uneventful year
-Legendary weapons and objects are fun, but honestly the most engaging use of the system is acquiring a crown, regalia, a throne, and other items when first growing your court

While this DLC is more expensive than expansions for older games by this developer, I can see its mechanics remedying many of the frustrations I had with the game and easily doubling the time I will put into the game. While maybe not for everyone, it's an easy purchase for me and sets a new standard for DLC releases by paradox.",1644433255,1644433255,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198073225754",227,3,0,0,NA,0

- La cour royale qui est assez mal conçu et qui est un simple gadget : elle ne sert à rien ! Tant d'argent, d'énergie usé pour quelque chose de nul qui ne sert à rien, alors qu'il y a plein d'amélioration à faire à ce jeu !
- Très peu de rajout de couronnes, coiffures, barbes et de vêtements, ils auraient pu ajouter des chevalières ou des capes en artefacts, mais non ils préfèrent laisser ça aux moddeurs..
- La personnalisation des armoiries est foireuse, c'est difficile à faire quelque chose de propre et tout n'est pas possible à faire !
- Les demandes à votre cour, c'est simple c'est comme les événements classiques mais au sein de la cour, ça complique les choses au lieu d'avoir des événement qui se rajoute aux précédents !
- Le nouveau système de culture est sympa, mais dommage car même si votre culture est occidentale vous pouvez encore mettre des vêtements indiens ou nordiques, donc on se retrouve submerger dans un torrent de comestique alors que les 3/4 sont ""inutiles""

Being able to see my ruler and all the artifacts his dynasty has collected throughout the generations is amazing. 

Also, the changes the expansion makes to culture, allowing you to diverge and create hybrid cultures is likely to drastically change the way you play the game.

I get that people are mad about the price. 30 bucks is a lot, but if you're a big fan of crusader kings, I would recommend checking this out. If you're tight on cash, or only play CK3 every now and then, try waiting for a sale.

"2012","109868925","109868925","english","This expansion is GOOD. The new systems are completely changing the way the a playthrough unfolds, and pretty much all for the better. Sure, there are a few interface annoyances, but they are minor compared to the sheer delight of seeing what new weird items your dynasty picks up on its journey through the centuries.
The culture rework is massive, and totally awesome, and I encourage people to think of it as part of the expansion even though it is free. The devs clearly had to make this feature free because it is so deeply embedded in the game systems that it can't be enabled just for the expansion and turned off for the base game. 
The decisions you make regarding the evolution of your culture are extremely rich in terms of both role-playing AND strategy, and I just love it. My African king sails up the coast and siezes Cordoba - prior to the rework this would have been purely for the mechanics of getting the special building and switching to a more advanced culture so I could feudalise. After the rework? Suddenly I don't want to change culture; sure they have more technology, but their traditions are crap (hit an run tacticians, lolwut?), so instead I am putting my steward to work trying to convince the Cordobans that my people are not that bad and we should merge our ways together. It's still a painfully slow process, so I try and speed it up by conquering some more Andalusian lands, which helps because our realms are intermingling more (even if in the short term the Andalusians are mad at me for declaring war on their territory). Eventually I create the new 'Cordoban' culture, gaining the technological knowledge of the Andalusians, the much cooler traditions of the Malinke (sorcerous metalurgy, yes please!), and teaching my people back home how to speak the much-more-useful Arabic language. And this is just round one of the story of my realm's evolving culture. Utter, freaking, briliant.
Think of this expansion as the next chapter in the evolution of the game, and if you buy it (you should) think of yourself as supporting the continued development of the game as a whole.

The new events and systems really flesh out the game more for what it is supposed to be, a character / dynasty simulator. The people who are only interested in war might not care as much about Royal Court for it but all of the new things to do really make the game more interesting. You know how it is, different strokes for different folks. 

Even more exiting is how good a system like this will be for modding, can't wait to see what the big fantasy mods can do with all of this when they are finally released. 

For those of us that play CK games as more than a map painting game, this is a great DLC that really makes the game feel more alive and interesting. If all you care about is warfare then it's something you can skip, there are weapons and other items that help in war, give you more stats and bonuses but I don't think it's worth buying the DLC for that alone. I usually like to play as a smaller lord but now I really enjoy being a King and managing my court. I really recommend Royal court for those of you who are interested in events, role playing and what not. 

As for pricing, I don't buy Paradox DLC at full price, sorry but I'm poor and can't afford it. They always give us a free patch that add some new things and improvements and I don't mind waiting for a good deal more in my price range. Always wait for a sale unless money is not an issue for you in my opinion, considering I bought the royal addition of the game on sale for like $45 or less (Paradox and others sell keys off steam for a little less that you can then use on steam. Check the safe/trusted sites for sales the same time you see a steam sale. Make sure you look into the site to make sure it's legit, not all key websites are safe or are even allowed to sell the keys they have.), and I'm happy with what I paid for. 

We knew the price of the major DLC for CK3 will be $30, we where told this before the game came out. They spent over a year on this and I think it's fair, just wait for a sale in the future if you are on the fence about pricing. Over time, as with all Paradox games you will be able to get DLC for 75% off if not higher at times, it's just a matter of waiting.",1644431109,1644431109,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198091796335",113,5,0,0,NA,0

Na pewno nowa mechanika nie jest kompatybilna ze starymi zapisami.
Jest równiez problem z wczytywaniem rozgrywki, ale w moim przypadku panaceum okazalo sie uruchamianie gry i ladowanie sejwa dopiero z menu w grze a nie w kliencie. 

Paradox ogrywal Royal Court na streamach juz dwa tygodnie przed premiera. Mieli sporo czasu na polerowanie i testowanie, wiec nie spodziewam sie jakis krytycznych bugów - sam zadnych nie doswiadczylem. Jednak wiadomo - co innego setka testerów a co innego milion graczy i róznych konfiguracji...

Moja wczesna opinia: 
Poszukiwanie i pozyskiwanie (wszelkimi mozliwymi sposobami) wybitnych osobistosci jest teraz kluczowe.

The content in this DLC is good and the features make the game notably more immersive. But it's massively overpriced. 

What you get: 
-The courtroom (where you can look at yourself and your court members as 3D models) + some repeatable events, both as vassal and liege
-The Grandeur mechanic (i.e., how extravagant your court is), which is an extensive moneysink and gives various bonuses the higher you get it
-Minor court positions, again, moneysink with minor bonuses for maintaining them
-Court artefacts (to exhibit in your throne room for bonuses) and personal artefacts (to put in your newly introduced equipment inventory for bonuses) and a couple of different ways of getting them. 

And that's about it. The content is decent but it's nowhere near an amount that would justify charging half the price of a newly released full price game for it.

CULTURES
The culture rework is nice: you can create new cultures, combine two into one, and create your regional culture out of already existing one - I like these changes
Each culture has now few traditions, the cultures got divided into groups - for example, Polish, Polabian and Pomeranian are in the Lechitic group. You can now learn other languages.

ARTIFACTS
Now you can hire a person to create an artifact for you - a melee weapon, a chestplate, a crown and many other things.
Or you can just steal them during a war with your neighbour. I've got an artifact that gives me -100% fertility :P
Many of these artifacts increase dynasty renown, prestige, fertility, prowess and other traits.

THE THRONE ROOM/COURT
For me it is a boring, laggy, unnecessary addition - they could've sold it separately... 
The court is only available to emperors or kings, AND you can not be a tribal government :(
You can see people there but they just stand and do nothing more.

ADVISORS
Now you can hire more advisors - the food taster, the jester, the court doctor, bodyguards, the language tutor etc.
It's a pretty cool addition because they are pretty cheap - 0,02 to 0,15 ducats monthly. They provide nice bonuses :)

"2109","109864097","109864097","english","An excellent DLC that enhances the game-play and adds more layers to what is already a fantastic game. It adds several layers that one may not realise on the surface. A lot of work and effort has gone into producing this additional content. I must congratulate the game development team for all their efforts in putting together the Royal Court and game update that was released at the same time as this DLC. It is much appreciated. Whilst there are still a lot that can be added to the game, it was a good place to start after the Northern Lords flavour pack. In my view, Royal Court is well worth the full price for such a feature-rich DLC. 

The enhanced culture system is great as it introduces a dynamic system that allows you to evolve your culture and this makes the game even more enjoyable to play. It also adds novel ways to gain new traditions and makes the game an even better story-telling experience. Showing off your artifacts, holding court and the extra court positions are wonderful additions as well. I can highly-recommend this DLC.

Cultures and artefacts came out nicely as well, more aspects of the game got deeper. 

I think that the DLC will add about hundred of hours of content, similarly to base game. So for me, £23 is a fair price, especially compared to 9 hour long AAA title, for £55, that you cannot replay because you've done everything you can. 

I still prefer this business model than AAA games one. Like ten fold amount of content for 45% of the price. I think it is fair.

People are being absolutely ridiculous about this DLC, and I don't think they have any idea how precarious PDX is right now, and how important this expansion was.

I would like to say, my review is that this is a very good expansion. To paraphrase something ProudBavarian said about the expansion, it can completely change the way you interact with the game and leans heavily into roleplaying which is the thing I most appreciate about CK3 as a title in particular. I saw a review that said it was $30 for ""minor mechanics"" and that is completely unfair-- adding a 3D space with positioned characters to a game where usually you spend 90% of the time staring at a map is a massive departure from form and a very ambitious addition to the game. 

Would it be cool if there were Tribal Courts, or lower level Duke and Count courts? Of course, but there is every expectation that such a thing will be added later, perhaps even in a free update. How could we expect that? By looking at the free culture features which came along with this update. The new culture system is a massive upgrade to the former system, as large in scope as the entire religion system was at release, and everyone got it for free. The one best way to make sure you never get Tribal or Ducal courts is to tell people not to buy this DLC, and not to buy the next flavor pack.

I think if you play CK3 to tell stories and revel in the drama that comes with building your legacy, this expansion is an absolute must-have.

Visually courts look nice. The lategame would have needed more challenges, decorating a court might be a fun lategame activity, but will it stay motivating longtime?

Languages feel useless, they were better represented by cultures. The language learing decisions could have just targetted French instad of Langue d'Oil.

I do not like the cultural overhaul, it is a step away from hostorical simulation and historical role-playing towards a min-/max-playstyle with stacking boni (what EU4 has become).

The artifact and the court systems, as well as the improved cultures, add much needed depth to the otherwise bland base game. The culture aspect is especially enjoyable with its wide variety of choices as well as providing an outlet for prestige that previously tended to build-up when playing feudal rulers. What is disappointing is the implementation of the court mechanic for feudal governments only. While ""tribal"" governments may not have historically held court in the same way it is portrayed in this DLC, there are plenty of historic analogues that could utilize this mechanic existing within what is CK3's current gross over-generalization of tribal/nomadic peoples in game. This fact is ironically contrasted with Paradox's own sponsored YouTube content leading up to the DLC's release, specifically those videos exploring historical Mongol court protocol. I hope to see this remedied in the future.

Additionally, the use of 3D models in Royal Court is a departure from previous content and the developer's aims feel misguided when considering what the majority of the community is looking to get out of this game. It seems likely that this decision soaked up much development resources leading to the aforementioned lack-luster and even partially implemented court mechanic., This is not to mention the the price tag, which is at least twice what you should be paying for DLC. If you'd like to play Royal Court, I would recommend waiting for a sale.

EDIT: Upon playing the DLC further, it seems like the artifact and, primarily, court interactions are somewhat superficial. Regardless, I am still pleased with the culture systems but at this point it may as well have been one of the smaller $5 content packs.",1644423891,1644453220,FALSE,5,0,"0.550636529922485352",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198049839009",333,1,0,0,NA,0

Price for Royal Court though is a total madness.

I didn't even pay for it, since I had it with the Royal Edition, but I understand why people gets so frustrated and angry at Paradox.
I can imagine the reasoning behind a 24£ price, but still it's a faulty one. I can buy a full game for that price or a couple of DLC. Is this DLC big enough to justify that pricing? Sorry, it's not.

I hope they will learn some day...

In the meantime, just wait for the price to drop and enjoy the patches, they still balance the game, hopefully for the best.

Feels very ""automated"", for instance most cultures popping up have the same ""bulky name issue"" as cadet houses often have, sometimes cultures arise with weird names and/or names very similar to other cultures.

Definitely not worth 29,99€, in my opinion that's about twice the value of this DLC. I payed a bit less than that, since I pre-ordered the ""deluxe edition"" of CK3, but I still feel like the price was too high for what I ended up getting.

As ""amusing"" as it was, it broke what little immersion i had. After that i turned the game off, it is clear that nobody ever tested this garbage. This event should be programmed as an extremely rare, not happen almost every single time you utilize the game's key mechanic. Also the way its implemented doesnt make any sense, it shouldnt be coded this way, when it just selects random charaters to usurp holdings, it makes zero sense for holdings of the queen to be usurped by a baby. One very impatient baby, considering it was going to inherent them anyway.

EDIT: After glossing over other reviews, I've decided to chime in with my opinion about the price matter and overall quality of this DLC. 
Look guys, when they're selling you the DLC that breaks graphics and adds a ton of bugs which they never bothered to test over a year while this ""expansion"" was in development, at this point you're basically doing their job for them and testing their product. So no, you shouldnt pay $30 for an opportunity to participate in the beta-test. They're the ones who should pay you. 

Also, what ppl in the positive reviews are calling ""new mechanics"" are really just new buttons you can press to get flat modifiers, like pay 100 gold to the artisan - get a legendary sword that adds 1 prowess (which is like nothing). Also you get to create hybrid-cultures, hooray! Its exactly like creating religions in the base game, only duller. Wow, so much innovation, this gameplay is fire.

Conclusion: do not buy, not even on sale. Even if they fix all the bugs, which they wont, its still a bad dlc that doesnt really add anything new to the game. Promo screenshots were just lie, you never have interesting feasts in your court or anything like that.

After all, why did people like previous installments of this franchize? Because of the storytelling and because of the interesting events. In this game you see basically all the events this game has in the first 3 hours you play, so it was obvious, for me anyway, that the first DLC desperately needed to add some storytelling content. But all you really get is a hall with broken lighting and frozen statues with ugly facial features, because this DLC also decided to downgrade the graphics, on top of adding a bunch of bugs. It doesnt add what it needed to add for this game, game is still just a boring map painting simulator. What little events it has are at best poorly thought out and at worst are immersion-breaking. Nothing worse that a game can be other than being boring.

dear paradox, if you want your games better received: hire new writers and hire at least some testers, i know you think you got an army of unpaid shills to do that, but actually you do pay, not with money, but with your reputation. Also get a new product manager, from the premise to execution this DLC screams of the lack of coherent vision of what this game wants to be.

People complain of the price; I don't understand - please read the store page and accept what it is you are getting before paying.  If you don't fancy it or feel it's not of value, don't buy it.  But don't read the description, buy it, play it for 10 mins then complain that you have been somehow duped.  The description is very accurate here and there are also play-through vids to watch. For just over £20 It is more than acceptable.  I live by the £1 per hour of game-play ethos, and I can categorically say I will get more than 24 hours out of this.

Thanks Paradox, keep up the good work.

Edit - for some reason Steam is showing zero hours of playtime for this; I assume it's because I bought the expansion pass on day one and it's not recognised. For the record I had about 6 hours of Royal Court playtime at the time of this review, before anyone gets their knickers in a twist. ;-)",1644422874,1644423388,TRUE,7,1,"0.490487366914749146",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197993520827",710,17,0,0,NA,0

This feels very much like a normal $20 DLC that should have come out 3 months ago. Of the 1.5.0 features, I was more excited for the free customizable banners than any paid feature. In addition, the lack of free camera in the court, and limiting it to kings and emperors were two of the first things I changed with mods. The base game is fantastic and made even better with the free features in 1.5.0, and this DLC is a step down by comparison.

That being said, Royal Court marks a decisive turn away from min-maxing and towards immersive role-play, and this is the first time I've ever lost track of time playing CK3. In a way, this DLC is almost necessary towards this role-play vision, even if the features are rather limited. I highly encourage Paradox to continue down this path with future expansions.

Overall I'd highly suggest waiting for a $10-$15 sale a year or two from now. However I firmly believe that you should still plan on getting it as some point if you like the role-playing side of CK3.

"2211","109859800","109859800","english","TLDR: It took about a year for them to release a 3D room which adds nothing to the gameplay.

Longer review, CK3 has had significant issues in terms of gameplay and interaction since it's creation. This doesnt address any of them. Want something new to do between 880-1200? Nah, nothing new exists. You'll still be expanding, dealing with the AI trying to jump you, and endless, endless succession problems. 

Grandure is a few button clicks to handle, new minor positions have little impact on your court, you still have to take time combing through endless generic NPCs with sub par stats trying to force themselves in positions they dont deserve and pissing them off has little consequences. 

The good feature, designing your own coat of arms, is free.

The events from holding court range from, terrible, to ""recycled events that were moved into the court"". On a positive though the ""Get a cat"" event seems to repeat pretty often so it's more common to get a cat instead of once a playthrough. 

Byz is still stupidly stable, the abbasids still collapse near endlessly, the AI still cannot assist in combat.

"2214","109859770","109859770","english","I have so much contempt for this ""expansion"". We were told that CK3 was this highly efficient and modular platform that was going to get barrels of content. In the same time frame that CK2 was out, we had received new religions, new governments, buckets of content and entirely fresh systems. Sure, the DLC model was parasitic then, but at least we were getting *something*. This is just... beyond the pale.

Thirty bucks gets you a 3D court room bauble that looks stiff and lifeless, adds nothing to the game other than being a gold sink for passive bonuses, and includes court positions that we mostly already had in CK2. Relics and artifacts? Already in CK2 as well, and honestly far less intrusive. Enjoy finding exciting relics that grant you tiny opinion boosts or +2 prowess and then having to pay tons of gold to some asshole so they don't degrade. Culture hybridization is just another set of rules like religion, but less enticing. The new culture system feels like something that could have been designed in a week. Add a flimsy window for adding cultural tenets or tendencies or whatever the fuck they are called, a couple decisions, and a new advisor job, and done. I guess some players will make meme cultures like Norse-Turkish and call the expansion great, but once you've messed with the culture system once or twice, there's not much more to see. It's shallow. The moment to moment experience of the game is relatively unchanged. Religions are still all the same, no new governments (which we knew going in, obviously, but still), and you'll still be going through the same twenty or so event chains until you beg for death. Only now you'll occasionally be checking in on the incredibly ugly and for many people laggy court room, because you have to spend your excess gold on something, even if it's just really boring passive bonuses.

It is profoundly offensive to offer this DLC for 30 USD when I've seen modders do much more with less time and fewer resources for free. The amount of content on offer here is like, maybe ten dollars worth, and even then I'd still regret buying it when mods will do more for free. This wraps up all of the content you get for the royal edition, and I'll admit I'm a total rube and part of the problem for purchasing that edition of the game. I haven't pre-ordered anything in years, and I made an exception for Crusader Kings because the second game is just that special to me.

"2232","109858760","109858760","english","Ok so I didn't spend enough time with the DLC yet, but it is everything I wished for. So far, my games were finished after I reached my major goal (which could be said as minor to some) and that's it, after that I started a new game with different goals, never finished one. Now, I found myself wanting to lose, just so I can sail to different territories and start anew with my CURRENT character, and going a different path, only to merge my old culture with a new one. Seeing the different artifacts being created, reading the events, looking at all the artifacts in the game changing hands (Saw Haestin steal the Stone of Scone just at the start) is so much fun. I just found the will to really play around even as a majorly bad ruler, just so I can achieve my new goals. Paradox, if you read these, please don't let others sway you, this is the way forward, making it possible for people to RP in new and different scenarios! I didn't even see the new 3D court yet, because due to my own failure I'm still tribal. Again, all I can say, the culture divergences, the languages, the artifacts, it's everything I wanted. A little bit more never hurts (or a lot more, hell yeah, I'm ready for it!) so just keep doing what you do, please!

EDIT: I forgot to mention, I usually never customize stuff. Even my CoA was just something that I kinda liked. Now, I've spent a good chunk of time just fiddling with the CoA's of my Kingdom, my Duchy and my house, plus I created new Custom faiths which I usually never do.

"2236","109858628","109858628","english","Whilst the cultural adjustments were a fine addition to the game - even if some of the tenets for particular cultures feel a bit off - and the mechanics surrounding the cultural hybridization are fun and can lead to a more varied game, they feel rather shallow. The fact they came free is a decent bandaid, the paid mechanics are not. The artifact system and the RPG-esque equipping system look good, but the artifacts themselves are less impressive and feel less earned than artifacts acquired in the predecessor. They give marginal bonuses and due to the sheer quantity of them you acquire, there's no sentiment or real incentive to keep a hold of them. In CK2 if you gained or lost an artifact, it felt good due to the RNG aspect of it or especially bad since there was no easy way to get it back once it was taken from you. In CK3, you can see plainly the purpose of the artifact system: a money sink. It's something for a player who inevitably snowballed due to the easiness of the game to spend money on once they became too big to collapse. The same goes for the court system. Whilst it gives you means to help tidy up your realm and become stronger thanks to some of the milestones for achieving certain levels of grandeur, it's something you're not really involved in beyond spending a pittance per month to increase the quality of clothing and food - which, by the way, gives no visual improvement to the courtroom itself - and after some years in-game, you gain some modifier bonuses to your realm. That's it. The court system feels isolated from the rest of the game in a way, and that probably gives some insight into how future DLCs will function. For example, you gain nothing by having the prior flavor pack, since the Norse don't get any unique visuals for their court once you achieve kingdom rank. Also, locking it to kingdom rank and above guts any potential for competing with your own liege for a grander court, which could have delegitimized them in the eyes of their subjects and given you a claim on their title. The game is lacking in little touches like that all throughout, and this new DLC only added a handful of events to give more life to your game.

I wouldn't recommend purchasing this, even if it was 10 dollars cheaper. The game only feels marginally less empty without it.",1644421210,1644421210,FALSE,1,0,"0.523809552192687988",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198058557727",200,4,0,0,NA,0

"2240","109858579","109858579","english","I have now tried this DLC for quite a few hours.
I'm sad to say, that i really can't recommend this DLC, when it cost 30 euros. Price sets expectations, and this really shouldn't cost more than 10 euros at the maximum no matter how i see it.

I have over the years bought pretty much every single Paradox DLC on day one, but over the last few years i just keep getting disappointed. They release half baked DLC with barely any features, and still demand 20-30 euros for them. I really can't support this anymore, since i no longer see an actual value in it, and would rather just keep playing on the previous versions to avoid any mishaps the new DLC and update brings.

The features of this DLC(and update) are the cultures and court.
Lets start with the court.

It's an extremely barebone 3D court that just gives you a few events and a few spaces to put down some artifacts, that gives a few modifiers. That's basicly it. The court is really ugly and seems like no effort has been put into it, which is a huge disappointment for a main feature of a 30 euro DLC. You get new court positions... that are just more modifiers, and hf appointing people to them whenever the old ones they were assigned to, dies or are otherwise indisposed.
The artifacts are just modifiers that are honestly really boring. Again it feels like no effort has been put into it.

The cultures seem more interesting. I always like to have options to personalise things in games, and this seems to add a bit to it. The feature seems fine for now, but it's a minor thing that doesn't change much. I like the addition of languages, since they add a little flavour to the game. Honestly can't say much more about it, besides it being a little like making your own religion.

So in the end i can't recommend this, unless you get it on a large discount. I'm sad to see this as the first expansion, since it feels like theres so much they can focus on in the game, to improve it so we can keep enjoying it. But this expansion is just a hollow sideshow that doesn't actually improve on the actual game, but is way more of a minigame inside a game.",1644421148,1644421148,FALSE,0,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198001458412",722,3,0,0,NA,0

This DLC launch is much better than what paradox has been putting out for what that’s worth. It adds many great and fun mechanics to ck3 and I’m sure that the pandemic had a role in development. But I can’t be the only one who looks at this clunky UI, new exploits and bugs/AI mishaps still prevalent since launch and ask: is this it? This DLC is a step in the right direction. It makes you interact with characters a lot more than before and that Is what crusader kings is all about. But for $30 the ask is much more than what the DLC actually gives, especially after waiting a whole year after launch (probably spent a longer time in development before launch) when several mods add many of these mechanics albeit not as polished as Royal Court. Wait for a sale. This DLC does nothing for the grey area that CK3 sits in.

Ultimately, I think the Royal Court makes for a successful ""first step"" into what will probably be like a decade of expansions.

The court stuff really does add a lot - it's not going to completely change your games, and I imagine the events are going to get repetitive, but as something to fiddle with and play around with during the downtime between expansion it's awesome. Snappy interface, and seeing your growing cast of characters all interacting adds more than you would think. Big fan of how they've implemented court positions as well - the two together make for a good moneysink and a nice way to flesh out that big cluster of courtiers you never remember anything about. Particularly women - I found in male-dominated regions, outside of spymaster and court physician, there was never anything to do with your skilled female courtiers, and this solves that problem nicely.

Artifacts are fun, and at least where I am it's not cheap or easy to farm them - in my first run, even after a century I'm only at 50% capacity, and a lot of the items I have gotten are kinda junk. Cultures seem interesting, but it's expensive to diverge, so I haven't messed around with them yet. Have seen some real-world cultures pop up - Tunisian and Kazakh, maybe some others - which is cool. Definitely gives regions an interesting flavor, without railroading things too hard. Tough line to walk but it seems successful.

All in all, I do think it lives up to the hype - its new systems feel appropriately big and transformative, not just window dressing. I just hope they have the pipeline up and running, because what we have is great, but we're gonna need more of it before it starts to get old again.",1644419729,1644419729,TRUE,1,0,"0.523809552192687988",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198015013479",516,9,0,0,NA,0

Sorry guys, this content is nice but the game is still relatively new and I think the priorities are all wrong. 
The culture stuff is magnificent don't get me wrong but most is focussed around a court that is locked to king tier and focuses on visuals and minor bonuses with artifacts. 

Meanwhile the game does need deeper mechanics, which is what you would expect early DLC to put effort into. 

I enjoy the DLC and culture hybrid, divergence etc is absolutely amazing and I will get plenty out of it but I find the decision to make visual assets and trinkets the first ""major"" expansion absolutely mystifying and I hope they focus on deeper mechanics and issues in future ( looking at you unplayable republics, poor law system and more engaging ways to interact with vassals for troops etc)",1644419496,1644419496,FALSE,16,0,"0.614608943462371826",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197987536128",229,20,0,0,NA,0

The amount of things this changes is outstanding and while it took a long time to get released it was definitely worth the wait. 3D Court was something I never thought I would see in a Paradox game and it blows my mind that were hear today.  

Those who are saying that this is just minor DLC don't know what they are talking about, this doesn't just add one core mechanic, it effects the entire game in a very deep level by adding Cultures, Languages, and an entire court system that makes the game deeper than ever.  Not to mention that it opens the door to new ways to mod the game that will only make the game that much better. 

The price is a little high, but as someone who has been playing Paradox games since the days of the original Crusader Kings I always see their prices as investments. Unlike most companies that leave their games buggy messes, Paradox games evolves overtime for years and age like a fine wine. (The only exception being maybe Rome since they can't seem to get Rome games right.)

For me, buying DLC has always been with the knowledge that this gives Paradox more money to do more great things cause for the most part this company has yet to fall like so many of my other favourite companies.  That may change one day but for now they still remain one of the best 4X developers out there and I can't wait to see what comes next.

Die Royal Edition ist im Internet weiterhin (!)legal(!) verfügbar und kostet dort mittlerweile weniger als das Addon Royal Court an sich. Das zunächst einmal dazu. Zum Addon an und für sich muss ich sagen, dass ich das Spiel auf Englisch spiele, mir deshalb noch keine Übersetzungsfehler aufgefallen sind, natürlich. Das wäre aber auch das allerletzte, was ich einem Spiel als Fehler ankreiden würde. Man muss leider sagen, Übersetzungen stehen natürlich ganz weit unten auf der Prioritätsliste. 

Ich will auch nicht darauf eingehen, was die neuen Features sind, da die bei diversen Presseorganen und Paradox selbst hinreichend erklärt wurden. Ich muss allerdings meine Enttäuschung zur Kenntnis geben, dass das Addon so veröffentlich wurde. Heruntergebrochen würde ich sagen, gibt es 3 Säulen des Addons: 1. Artefacte, die ganz nett sein können, da sie diverse Boni bieten und u.a. auch Kriegsgründe liefern können, 2. der Thronsaal, ein 3D Raum, wo im Moment noch nicht wirklich viel Action ist und 3. Sprachen und Kulturen verändern, was man aber sich auch erst einmal leisten können muss, wenn man bedenkt, dass selbst kleine Änderungen (1 Slot) min. 3000 bis 4000 Prestige kosten. 

Als Fazit muss ich leider sagen, dass ich 30 Euro für das Addon als deutlich zu viel ansehe. Ich bin froh, seinerzeit die Royal Edition gekauft zu haben, ich wüßte nicht, ob ich Royal Court nicht wieder retounieren würde, wenn ich es mir hier so gekauft hätte. Vom Preis Leistungsverhältnis würde ich es eher bei ca. 15 Euro veranschlagen, 20 höchstens, wenn man sehr wohlwollend für den Entwickler und angesichts der Inflation etc, sein möchte. Aber 30 Euro sind definitiv zu hoch gegriffen.

"2371","109852752","109852752","english","Royal Court so far is a 7/10. It is acceptable. I were not disappointed since I had low expectations. For people with Royal Edition, is Royal Court worth 30 euro? No. 20 euro? No. 15 euro? Yes. In other words wait for sale.

I have seen people comparing this to Witcher 3 Blood & Wine DLC price. Royal Court doesn't justify the price, unlike Blood & Wine; that is just the sad reality.

However, I recommend Royal Court to roleplaying enthusiasts who love to have a throne room, upgrade the amenities of your court and appoint courtiers and nobles to prestigious positions of your court. Don't expect it to be ""the Sims"" in the middle ages. You can't pick the wallpaper color or carpet, but you can display banners, furs and artifacts you have gotten through looting or crafting.

Holding court is done through events; you still choose between different answers to interact with your vassals and courtiers. There are no 3D models moving up to you and bowing, kneeling or kowtowing, if that is what you were hoping for. 

Most of the new events come from holding court or interacting with your liege's court. I have only done one playthrough, so I can't say if there are many new events for outside of holding court.

At the time of this review; equipping gear on yourself doesn't show on your 3D model, it just gives stat boosts to yourself (weapons give prowess), prestige and renown.

I can see this being fun the first few playthroughs, but it will get stale pretty fast once you have discovered all the mechanics. 

Culture mechanics has gotten an upgrade. You can now customize your culture in several different ways: You can create a hybrid culture or diverge from the original culture. Paradox has given us a lot of options to tweak our culture with different traditions, heritage and cultural pillars. There are too many to list, but last I counted there were at least 30+ different culture traditions you can customize your culture with. You can, for example, create a warrior culture, spiritual culture, bureaucratic culture or meritocracy. Or mix the many different traditions into one crazy culture.

Conclusion: Steer away from Royal Court if you are not a roleplayer. Even if you are one, don't buy it until it has at least 50% discount. For those who got the cash to burn and are roleplayers: It is decent. Not bad, not great.

I have all DLC for several other PDX games and I can say without a doubt that for costing 1.5x, 2x, or even 3x as much as some other DLC, this does not provide nearly enough content to justify the price. Given how long it took PDX to make this relative to other DLCs, I could understand the price if they put A LOT more content in it, and it quite surprises me that they didn’t, given the development length. It is not a game-compromising expansion (wink wink Leviathan) and the stuff that it has is quite good. Buy it at a 50% sale. I think that given all of the facts, this game’s dev team is getting the short end of the stick, and I regret my role in supporting that, especially when this game has such potential. Please prove me wrong PDX.  I think, in the future, I might just save my money and finally get all CK2 DLC.

1) You get a Royal Court Room (from kingdom rank upwards, if you are feudal), for storing Artifacts, and sinking some money in grandeur to get some bonuses or multiplier for them. This is not really adjustable and immersion breaking. If you are holding court, you need to stop game, because outside things still happen, even pop ups can occure and you can't proper handle them.

2) You can individualisze your culture ingame. This can also give you some decent bonuses. Some cultures already have good bonuses, so you can simply switch your culture and then there isn't that big of a need for creating your own. PDX lets you sniff on what you don't have in the free version. But you won't miss the mixing or creation of an own culture, because it is an idea, good for a game like Imperator Rome (maybe they had the idea there and because of stopping development they added it in CK3, because the DLC itself is really scarce even with this ""feature"".

3) You get some court jobs more than the free version.

This is what you get and everything else, what people are talking about, is part of the free update.

After reaching first achievements:

Got the first achievements and the ""style"" is either 20 years old, or it only shows how less they care about how ugly it looks. Overall it feels like they already sold so many copies of the Royal Edition that nobody could get the money back and they already ""earned"" it, so why any more effort than the bare minimum.

Original comment:

Don't ask if it is the needed free update coming along with this or the DLC itself. Game isn't running smooth any more. Multiplayer doesn't work proper because you get logged out from PDX (yes you need to be logged in to PDX to play Multiplayer - the dumbest thing ever, because we use Steam to not being forced to log in somewhere else) randomly during multiplayer sessions. It happens every couple minutes.

Many stutter while in court. You get declared ware and while you get attacked the court room opens up, so you can't call your army or so, first need to close this thing again.

If you pay 30 bucks for it, it is worth 10! Maximum! What you get is, what you mostly know from CK2, just with beautier graphics. Almost nothing new, many stuff that was in game before is now part of your court, so more clicking buttons, waiting, stutter.

This DLC is frustration and is following PDX new tradition of bad DLCs.",1644410600,1644602293,FALSE,6,0,"0.522727251052856445",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198255781351",106,24,0,0,NA,0

"2469","109848448","109848448","english","Here's how I'd sum this up -
This DLC adds a lot - Royal Courts for vassals, kings, and emperors, which themselves are a very interesting element of both gameplay and especially immersion. CK2 was a wonderful game but it was hard to ever see my character as a living, breathing person. Royal Court adding the ability to see them in an actual space was wonderful.

The return of Artifacts is wonderful, especially with the new interface for slotting them in. It's a thousand times easier to see what you have equipped and what it does now than in CK2, a real masterclass in how to take a base feature everyone liked and make it even better in a sequel. The combination of Royal Courts and Artifacts also makes for some of the most gorgeous things in the game, the Court Artifacts are splendorous things - wonderful tapestries, excellently-designed boxes that bleed a living medieval feeling, that communicate the life and vivacity of the period.

On top of that, the biggest thing that EVERYONE interacts with is the cultural revamp - culture was already a fairly interesting and new thing compared to the nothingness it was in CK2, but now every culture is encouraged to play differently - a Dutch player will focus on making money, Saxons on conquest, et cetera et cetera. What's more, if you want to revamp your base culture, hybridization lets you put together the best of both cultures, so that instead of a genocidal maniac, you might actually play like a decent monarch (Though be honest, most of the playerbase will still probably wipe out the other cultures.) 

Of course, the main downside is the pricetag. $30 is a hell of a lot for a DLC, even one this major. I could even see $25 at a stretch, but $30 is putting the toe across the line. I'm recommending the game based mostly on the actual content- it makes picking this up definitely worthwhile, but if you don't have a lot of cash to burn, wait for a sale.",1644409678,1644409678,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198008454846",265,6,0,0,NA,0

Especially the ""hold court"" feature. It's such a waste of time feature that shouldn't even be advertised on steam page. It's basically a decision to encounter vanilla random event instead of waiting for it to trigger randomly. 

The grandeur system is also ridiculous in its implementation. It's mostly a slider that convert gold into grandeur. Why they don't implement the somthing similar to 'display artifact' system is beyond me.

Reviews exist to give people an idea if the sold content is good. Everyone can see the price and make an independent decision if they can afford it or if it's worth it to them. Nobody gains anything of value by wading through your tirades.

And if you think that your tears will make Paradox change their mind about pricing, no it won't.

"2501","109847163","109847163","english","Royal court is a amazing expansion that is slightly ovepriced. The new features they have added to the game really enrich the experience. The new culture system revamps what felt like a outdated system when compared to the religious one. Cultures really do feel unique rather than just the technological difference from before now certain tenets of a culture grant stat bonuses,events and even languages which you can learn to make other cultures like you a bit more. Hybridizing with new cultures and diverging feels rewarding and really adds to the roleplaying and storytelling potential of the game. This is easily the best feature of this DLC.

The new court is great from both a artistic and gameplay perspective it gives a ton more content when playing as both a vassal and a liege. You can now directly petition your liege for things and have your vassals do the same to you. This really improves the roleplay in the game, pulling the player out of the map screen and into the 3D court room makes these interactions feel far more personal. I actually tend to remember these and when a certain vassal consistently annoys me or when my liege refuses my requests it makes you want to screw them over when the opportunity arises.

The only major issue with the DLC is the price. There is a ton of content here and it's content that will impact your game regardless of where you play on the map (unlike the single culture focused flavor packs) and it's far bigger than any of the individual expansions for CK2 were, but even then the 30 dollar price tag really is a bit steep and it stains a otherwise perfect expansion, however I would still recommend it because I truly do think it's still worth money due to the huge improvement on the game that it makes. I sincerely hope paradox reconsiders it a bit as compared to the really well priced flavour packs this feels a bit over priced I really think these expansions should be $20 instead or at least $25",1644407997,1644487328,TRUE,4,0,"0.44692644476890564",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198126731783",726,37,0,0,NA,0

Is it worth 30€? Idk, not in my opinion.

But if you like CK3 and want more detailed gameplay this dlc works for you. 
Get back your personal inventory, order people to forge swords, shileds, armor etc to boost your strenght in combat. And i must say the bonuses of the artifacts in the court room are insanly OP sometimes.

But enough with items, Holding Court is a fun experience of being a king/emperor, bring 2-3 people to  a hearing infront of you, solve issues and grant them aid, or yeah do whatever you want with them. Every decision you make will influence relations and your court ""value points"".

Court appointments are interesting as well. You can now assign people like ""Cup bearer"", Body Guard, Court Jester, Food Tester etc but beware. Most of the roles have heavy scheme influence on you if they turn, like the food tester, cup bearer and other close appointments.
They all give good prestige, piety etc bonuses but ofcourse cost upkeep between 0.1-1 gold.

I would personally wait for a sale, or support the devs now and pay full price, your choice.
This is my opinion about the game and everyone has their own experience.

"2537","109845611","109845611","german","Kann man dieses DLC empfehlen??
Ja und Nein.
Zuerst mal das Ja 
Die Kulturen Verbindung gut und diese gab es ja früher um Fortschritt zu bekommen, allerdings hätte ich mir in Kulturverbindung dann mehr auf den Nordmannen oder aus dem Moslembereich genommen, da mit diesen doch sehr viel Kontakt besteht.
Die religiöse Verbindung kann man oder muss man noch mit rein nehmen damit die katholische Kirche noch stärker werden kann, da iwr ja alle wissen, dass die Kirche Eigenschaften von anderen Religionen geklaut haben und dann den anderen christlichen Glauben zerstört hat.
Das Wappen selber herzustellen macht schon Spaß nur hätte ich dann sehr gerne aber dann ohne Voreinstellungen gearbeitet und selber Wappen erschaffen.
Ist ja schön und gut, aber so bin ich doch nicht frei, wenn ich zuerst ein Wappen nehmen muss um dieses dann zu verändern.

So zu den Neins
Nach mehreren Stunden des Spiels, zuerst als Graf, finde ich den Thronsaal ziemlich nervig nach einer gewissen Zeit und dieses 3D passt einfach nicht dazu.
Für mich wäre es schöner ein Bild des Thronsaales und dann so die Artefakte zur Ausstellung bringen, genauso wie als man persönlich die Artefakte und Rüstungen trägt.
Zum anderen das Huldigen seinem König ist auch nervig, aber diese komplett bescheuerte aufploppen der Pedition für ein Amt ist noch mehr nervig, man sollte dies doch so machen, dass man dann selbst anklicken kann ob man ein Ratsposten haben möchte und diese ganze Zeit des zeigen nervt.
Zum anderen ist der Preis von knapp 30 Euro einfach überteuert und nicht angemessen, so zwischen 15 und 20 Euro wäre in Ordnung aber so nein.

Fazit:
Das DLC bringt viel neues nur hoffe ich, dass noch einiges nach gepatcht wird und dass dieser Thronsaal in 3D verschwindet, denn ist man in diesem Thronsaal drinnen sieht man nicht mehr was auf der Karte los ist.
Kaufempfehlung schon nur es muss halt jeder selber wissen ob er jetzt das DLC kauft oder später wenn dieses billiger ist.
Ich für mich als CK3 Fan stand nie außer Frage, dass ich mir den DLC hole.
Und daher zum Schluss müsste ich meinen Daumen eigentlich in die waagrechte bringen geht aber leider nicht und deswegen ist für mich das DLC AUSGEGLICHEN in der Bewertung",1644405729,1644405729,TRUE,7,0,"0.56793510913848877",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198392425734",123,17,0,0,NA,0

1) The price. Come on Paradox, we all know you love DLC, but the price of this DLC is extortionate. 

2) I opened up an Ironman save file today from before the DLC was released. My Prestige, Piety and Renown have all been tanked back down to 1 and my young ruler now has the ""Dying"" trait. Good job! 

I love the CK franchise and I have loved playing CK3 up until this point.

Ja es gibt noch einige Übersetzungsfehler, leere Platzhalter und einige TODOs der Entwickler sind auch noch hier und da hinterlassen. Diese finde ich aber nicht so drastisch als würden sie das Spiel nicht spielbar machen. Und bei so vielen Sprachen und vor allem einem so textlastigen Spiel kommen Fehler nun mal vor. Ja, man könnte mehr in die Qualitätssicherung investieren und ich hoffe, dass Spieler aber auch so fair sind und diese Fehler auch melden und diese dann gefixt werden, anstatt sich nur darüber auszulassen.

Zum Thema Preis/Leistung kann ich auch verstehen wenn viele sagen, dass es die 30€ nicht Wert sind. Der neu hinzugekommene Content mag für die Zeit und das Geld was darein gesteckt wurde tatsächlich nicht verhältnismäßig wirken, man muss aber bedenken, dass nicht nur neuer Content hinzugekommen ist , sondern dieser auch in bestehender Logik berücksichtigt und implementiert werden muss. Kulturen, Sprachen, Artefakte, die neuen Hofämter usw. muss komplett ineinandergreifend auch im bestehenden Spiel eingebaut werden. Hierbei alle Eventualitäten die auftreten könnten zu testen und zu prüfen ist schon eine Mammutarbeit und ich finde für den Zustand in welchem sich das Spiel jetzt befindet, finde ich es nach wie vor beachtlich.

Fazit:
Ja, es hätte vielleicht mehr Qualitätssicherung betrieben werden können..
Ja, der neue Content scheint nicht im Verhältnis zum Preis zu liegen...
Ja, es gibt noch Bugs und Übersetzungsfehler..

ABER..

Meiner Meinung nach ist der Preis gerechtfertigt, da neuer Content auch in bestehender Logik implementiert werden und berücksichtigt werden muss UND das Ganze in allen Sprachen zu testen UND auch noch alle Eventualitäten zu prüfen...

"2543","109845295","109845295","english","This is a good dlc. Not the best obviously. But the main issue is; IS IT AN EXPANSION?

Let's be honest, we have been waiting for an expansion for 16 months(give or take). What we end up is, kind of a flavor pack, which would be good a polish for a finished game. CK3 lacks content and playstyle varieties, which this dlc can't compete with. This dlc would only suit if it came up for CK2. Getting a new duel system is kind of an equal, what this DLC brings. It feels like a mere patch.

+ Court design and events are nice to get occupied
- Events are repetitive( had the same events in 2 hours of gameplay)
+ Artifacts are nice
- You spent 50 gold to get them, which is odd(easily affordable)
- You get new objectives for council members WITH A DLC. It is really weird to include this in DLC.
+ Learning new languages, diverging cultures or hybridizing them, are kind of an occupation you ask for during your 5x game.

I'm glad i got this as part of the Royal Edition on GMG back at release, where the whole game was just about 45 euros with the 3 future DLCs bundled in, otherwise I'd feel more bitter about this first ""major"" expansion for CK3 if i paid more.

It brings back the inventory system and artifacts which is nice to see again and now there's a 3D court you get to see and even fill with things you earned, minor titles are also back and more interesting and fleshed out unlike in CK2 where all they did was just get you 10+ opinion for a character and there's also the culture stuff that was expanded which is cool  but the culture stuff hasn't been all that super exciting for me personally, mainly what happens now is you end up forming mega hybrid cultures that just gets more and more out of hand as you play.

Overall it's just kinda lack luster for the asking price, like the content it self is not bad at all, in fact it's good but the price is awfully high for the amount of content it contains.

"2610","109842754","109842754","english","Price vs Content in this dlc is not worth it at all! ( that alone is a do not recommend )  It's $42.95 in AUD 

Review for the actual content. 

The court system,
All the court system is gameplay wise, is a money sink to get extra prestige and renown with some random events thrown in. Why is it a money sink? with the new court you have to spend upkeep to up the grandeur of your court, if your court is below the grandeur of other courts around you, you lose ticking prestige, the upkeep isn't to expensive but early game it will chunk your money a decent bit. 

The inventory and equipment that I've seen so far is mostly just more extra prestige, renown and prowess aka mostly stats that don't matter really. 

Now you're sitting here like that actually sounds pretty good if you wanted to do a tribal run, well NOPE tribals don't get courts so I guess F tribals. You do still get inventory / equipment though so when you do eventually swap to feudal you can spice up your court ( but honestly you should have a court from the get go though ofc smaller) 

Culture Update, Honestly it just boils down for a way to skip innovations as a tribal so you can go feudal faster so you can actually use the court. 
For the most part the culture hybrid is nice to just get rid of shitty traditions for the obviously better ones and if you like hey that just sounds like reforming your faith you'd be 100% correct, that's all there is to it. 

( calling it now there gonna be some youtube video about how OP norse / greek combo is, greek will all the innovations and a bunch of traditions that lower M@A upkeep and norse with their OP M@A yep just gonna steamroll everyone ) 

Honestly the most slept on part ( though I don't believe it's apart of the dlc just the free patch but that is the Coat of Arms designer, you can now design your house, count, duke, kingdom and empire coat of arms at ANY point in the game, you can also change your factions colour which is nice)

The artifact system is a little to generous with the rate at which you can acquire them, but it is far and above better than CK2s. As for the culture rework, PDX have done what base game CK3 did for religion, they have made it so much more than just a name and colour on a map.

"2641","109841659","109841659","french","Ce DLC et la mise à jour qui l'accompagne rafraîchissent considérablement l'expérience en jeu. Il y a de nouvelles musiques, de nouveaux portraits, les visages ont été retravaillés, les cultures aussi, et j'oublie énormément de fonctionnalités, je ne cite que ce qui m'a marqué. Le principe de la Cour Royale est excellent : Quel plaisir de pouvoir enfin, agir en véritable souverain ! Malheureusement, et c'est là une première déception pour moi, la cour Royale n'est disponible que pour les Rois et Empereurs. Je trouve ça dommage, car c'est véritablement une fonctionnalité agréable, et on a pas toujours la possibilité d'être roi ou Empereur dans une partie (Il aurait été sympathique de l'avoir pour les ducs indépendants, style petits royaumes irlandais, et ça aurait été logique. Certains gros ducs, comme le duc de Normandie en France, etc...). Ce qui fait qu'on retombe, en conséquence, dans les boucles de gameplay habituelles de crusader Kings. Autre problème de la cour royale : La répétitivité. J'y ai joué environ 2h30, et je retombe déjà sur les mêmes problèmes lors de mes audiences (J'en ai fait quoi, 3 - 4 ?). C'est dommage, parce qu'à long terme, les audiences vont perdre énormément en intérêt.
Vos vassaux, vos courtisans peuvent venir vous voir pour régler leurs différents, là dessus rien à dire, c'est varié et sympathique. On peut aussi récupérer un territoire de jure par la diplomatie (Quelle Chance !), utile quand on est pas un va en guerre. En ce qui concerne les Artefacts, peut-être suis-je dur, mais je trouve qu'il y a trop de propositions pour en créer. Ce n'est pas assez rare si vous voulez. Le principe des langues que l'on peut apprendre est sympathique, ça rajoute un côté ""RP"". Mais, petit problème selon moi : On a pas moyen de savoir quelle langue est parlée ou. On peut savoir quelle langue est la langue des courts voisines, mais on ne peut savoir quelle langue est parlée dans les comtés, les duchés... Je trouve ça vraiment dommage, car ça atténue grandement ce sentiment de ""Multiculturalité"" de nos royaumes et empires, un comble pour une maj qui cherche précisément à nous donner ce sentiment, via la refonte des cultures. 

        Quel est le rapport qualité prix de ce DLC, désormais ? Grande question. Il est indéniable que les développeurs ont beaucoup travaillé dessus. La cour Royale est splendide, c'est une petite révolution et sans doute, est-ce là une raison de son prix. Mais je ne peux m'empêcher de penser que 30 euros, c'est excessif. 30 euros, c'est le prix d'un jeu, voir même plusieurs. Or, ici, pour 30 euros, vous avez accès à d'excellentes fonctionnalités, certes mais des fonctionnalités finalement bien légères et très générales (C'est du mieux un peu ici, un peu là, mais il n'y a pas de véritable transformation du gameplay, la court royale apporte un supplément vraiment bienvenu mais peut-être un peu, disons, léger ?).  La mise à jour gratuite qui accompagne le DLC est superbe, dans l'ensemble on ne peut qu'être satisfait. Mais ça reste cher payé. Je pense que 20 euros aurait été un prix plus correct (20 euros, le prix d'un gros DLC de Stellaris pour ceux qui connaissent...). Je ne peux néanmoins que vous le recommander, car même si je suis très critique envers cette extension j'en suis satisfait. Mais si vous pouvez, attendez les réductions.

EDIT : Les devs on rajouté la court royale pour les gouvernements tribaux ! Cela, sans compter quelques autres ajouts en termes d’événements...

"2661","109840776","109840776","english","Bottom line.... What you pay for what you get, is terrible value. Terrible.

I love the game, love the genre and have a ton of hours played in a multitude of games from conquer everything to roleplaying a characters traits and everything in between. Oh the content that is there is great and it adds more events and another layer to the game but, again, the cost of the DLC for what you get is not worth the price tag.

You're spoon fed... 'We're giving you this awesome free patch! With all this stuff.' Reality is that it is a patch. A patch to fix bugs and issues, not free content. It was coming anyway. In fact, if anything, they are making fundamental changes to the game so they can then add content that they can charge for and disguising half of it as a free patch for everyone to make them seem like they're doing you a favour. It and they are really not.

 So after all the great free patch content you get we then move on to the content that you need to pay for in 'Royal Court'. What is there is very welcome and does add another layer to the game but there is simply not enough meat on the bone to justify the price tag. The royal court can only be accessed by Feudal Kingdom and above and whilst that in itself isn't a bad thing and I have no issue with it, there perhaps should be, for the asking price, a lower different option for Pagan's. Maybe a less involved tribal tent or longhouse or something with different options but something to give you the feel of staying in that lane. This is purely based on the asking price and what we were sold.... 'more grander content less frequently.' Royal Court is just lacking that grandness. In spades.

 End of the day, I'm a sucker and have happily paid for the extra things that are there because I love the game and I know I've gotten my value out of what i've paid tenfold but it still doesnt make it right. For the asking price, there should be a lot more to show for it.

"2675","109840332","109840332","english","I really have to care about a game to dedicate the time to write a steam review that's more than a couple sentences.

Firstly, CK3 as a base game is still fun and probably the most approachable iteration of ck made thus far. Royal court succeeds in making ck3 more fun to play, but that is where its success ends. Royal court adds very little content and none of it brings any meaningful changes to how you play ck3. Culture sees the most notable improvement and brings some solid RP mechanics, even if it only really manifests as additional opinion modifiers. The new events are much welcome but they don't alter the gameplay loop at all and the same events appear far too frequently, just like when the game launched. Intrigue is simultaneously the most useful character focus while remaining the most frustrating, since it ensures you'll get a notification once a month that some random countess is humping her court bishop, or that your marshal had a random courtier assassinated 20 years before your current character was even born. The court visualizer was a promising feature, but it feels like they dedicated far too many resources to visualize something that could have been portrayed just as well with 2d artwork and some descriptive text. Nothing has been done to address the incompetent AI, but at least I know Kaiser Henry the fourth has a ""stinky court.""

Speaking on more than just the DLC's additions, ck3 does a very poor job of simulating any government type other than feudal, and even then their feudal government type is applied far too broadly. The expansion introduces no unique administration systems for the ERE or the (non-existent) nomads, nor does it offer a proper iqta or republic rework. Republics remain nonfactors and are still not playable. In my 300+ hours since launch I have not once seen a republic such as venice or pisa attempt to expand their realm. Compared to its most recent predecessor, ck3 still stale and predictable, especially after your first 50-80 years as a ruler. Regardless of your ruleset, the AI is incredibly passive and the only challenge for someone that is familiar with the game's mechanics comes in the form of arbitrary law/succession restrictions that bring no meaningful difficulty and just makes new playthroughs feel like a slog as you wait 200+ years to institute primogeniture. Mongols are still the only plausible challenge you'll face after your first 3-4 rulers, but from my experience they still collapse before stretching beyond the Caspian.

I'm having some fun with my current playthrough, but once I wrap that up, ck2 with HIP will remain my preferred way to play crusader kings.",1644397969,1644397969,FALSE,4,0,"0.488457053899765015",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198072290790",1425,13,0,0,NA,0

The sad truth with paradox games lately (over the past 5-6 years) is that they are giving way too much player agency to compensate for a lack of mechanics implemented. For a part of the community, this gives the impression of playing a game in a rather unrealistic dull environment. Yes, CKIII with all its plots, etc. is freaking dull in my opinion. 

The events end to be all the same, there is no big differences playing one culture or another except for a few min-max % modifiers in whatever category you won’t care about, same for religions. You’re spending renown, faith or whatever for reasons you don’t quite understand.

Examples:
-	In this expansion you are given the possibility to diverge your culture. In place of having a compelling dynamic way of seeing cultures emerge and being mixed up together (being dynamically created) it’s in the player power to diverge the culture of a whole country. 
-	Another example: there is no link between the artifacts you have and the possibility to wear it in the barbershop. So, if you want to put your papal tiara on without possessing it well, go ahead. What’s the point of trying to gain those artifacts only for their modifiers?...
-	You can improve the splendor of your court, etc. But for what? Again, a few min-max modifiers? What’s the point? 

By trying to be as sandboxy as possible to please a certain crowd, paradox is losing its way with players that want to play a simulation, where things happen organically. For a certain crowd here, the fun seems to lie in creating weird faiths, playing with nude characters or be as incestuous as possible. I wanted to give another point of view from the part of the community that would like paradox to go back to simulation games, with realistic thriving stories dynamically happening in the game and less player control.

Anyway. Fingers crossed for Vicky III, please don’t mess this one up.",1644397538,1644414883,FALSE,31,1,"0.653273820877075195",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198007469054",126,4,0,0,NA,0

Essa DLC certamente levou muito tempo para sair, mas o conteúdo não é, em nada, maior que as DLCs antigas de CK2, EU4 e outros jogos mais antigos, certamente não justifica o preço de 60 reais em comparação as demais.

Sobre a DLC, seus focos principais são:
-O sistema de corte, que ignorando a parte inútil do 3D cria novas formas de se gastar dinheiro para obter alguns bonus, e alguns eventos adicionais.
-Um sistema de equipamentos, que já existia no CK2
-Um novo sistema de cultura, onde a mesma tem grandes efeitos nas habilidades de cada personagem, suas tendências, e até valores culturais além dos religiosos.

Apenas a parte da cultura, na minha opinião, adiciona algo de grande relevância para a gameplay, como falei, é legal, é melhor ter a DLC do que não ter a DLC, mas se você não tem pressa compre nas promoções.",1644395606,1644395606,FALSE,22,0,"0.729064047336578369",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197988940274",808,80,0,0,NA,0

Der beste Teil finde Ich sowieso die Kultur, welches grösstenteils ja sowieso gratis ist.
Ich kann zwar verstehen, dass in diesem DLC einiges an Aufwand eingeflossen ist (Events etc.), jedoch wurde hier meiner Meinung nach an den falschen Stellen gearbeitet. Dieser Aufwand in gute Mechaniken investieren würde mehr bringen als statische 3D Modelle.

However it also makes success in your dynasty that much more rewarding. As of the many new extra events they've included so far i haven't seen too many but the ones that i have seen are pretty interesting, i have also only done one play-through as the count of Wien so possibly expanding your religious and cultural differences would help with finding more new events. But as for the good stuff. Once my count finally reached the king of Germany the amount of new things i could do was pretty impressive and you could tell that they spent a lot of work on the 3D models.

In my opinion, the dlc is fun. It adds a ton of flavour and depth to the game, and I do not regret my purchase. That being said, it launched today and I have had nowhere near the amount of time or experience with it to properly give a good review. Because it launched less than 24 hours ago. Today.

Au moins, le prix aurait été pleinement justifié et les consommateurs auraient compris qu'ils paient aussi, quelque part, pour cette maj qui change beaucoup de choses. C'est une forme de redistribution en somme.

Pour se focaliser sur le DLC en lui-même, celui-ci ajoute quand même pas mal de choses : un grand nombre d'évènements et de possibilités de gameplay pour les rois/empereurs et leurs vassaux. Bien sûr, cela renforce leur pouvoir, mais cela nous renvoie à une certaine réalité (bien que je pense qu'il aurait été préférable de l'étendre aux ducs indépendants). Mais cela apporte avant tout de nouvelles possibilités dans une phase (mid/late game) où le jeu pouvait commencer à s'essouffler et où il ne restait souvent plus qu'à blober ses voisins. Désormais, de nombreuses interactions seront ouvertes et vous devrez répondre aux attentes de vos vassaux.

En somme, vous pourrez estimer que ce DLC n'est pas très intéressant. Mais il pose de nombreuses bases pour l'évolution du gameplay de cet opus et tend à le démarquer de ses prédécesseurs.

I personally could no longer play without Royal Court and what it adds. In that way, it's like a drug. Sure, you don't necessarily [i]need[/i] it, but it makes you feel good, and once you try it, you're hooked. Then you need it. 

My advice is that if you want it, or think you need it, you should probably buy it. If you don't think you need it, then don't get it.

I have only played using this DLC for a couple hours but found that it massively improved playability. The 3D court room, artifact system, and other mechanics make this game more involved to an incredible degree. It may have taken Paradox longer to develop, but thus far I have found it to be well worth the wait, especially within the framework of remote development due to COVID. I paid full price for the game and full price for this DLC and have no complaints, if Paradox maintains this level of detail I will continue to be pleased with the latest installment of Crusader Kings.

Each of the main features of the  culture mechanic, royal court, artifacts, and court titles all bring fun new options that have forced me to slow down my play style.

This DLC in some parts - language, for instance - can be lacklustre. But where the DLC matters, the court and culture overhauls, it blows expectations out of the water.

I played the game nonstop from when Royal Court released (10 to 5pm) up until around half 2am nonstop because I found it so enjoyable. The AI utilising the features in the expansion is very nice to see, especially the new culture mechanics. In one game I saw a Han count form Tibet and create a Han-Tibetan culture. The AI can and will use these mechanics flawlessly.
The royal court itself is a really fun feature and I completely disagree with what others have been saying of it. I don't believe it gets boring at all, I loved creating a long lasting legacy in my court with artifacts and an ever increasing court grandeur. It follows the story of your dynasty and suppliments it in really unique ways that the game is richer for.

So yes, some things aren't as developed as they should be, but this is just a fact of life in the covid-lockdown era world of game development. The parts that are developed fully are done with so much attention and care that it easily hides the parts with less polish.

Well, After much overhyping and delays after delays with no information and them finally giving us a date before December can say now that i was right in my original judgement. The ""Massive Update"" is something you can binge in under 8 hours they put all of their eggs in the new court system that half the time does not function as intended. During this update they seriously screwed something up all old saves NPCS dropping like flies and in new game they did something to character generation as many look like Abominations against God whom will soon suffer the Lords Wrath in the upcoming Crusade. Having said that, The court system is admittedly interesting. When it does work it is pretty neat but majority of time it just looks derpy as all hell. I regret buying this game on day one with Royal Edition in the future i'd advise others to wait for DLC to actually come out and be covered properly before buying from this particular team at Paradox. Its been 11 hours since release and even people on Vanilla are crashing to Desktop because a music file is incorrectly pathed. The playerbase found the issue within hours and yet devs still do nothing. 

The upside to this DLC? LL will finally get some adult mods

Downside? Broke almost every single mod so if it isn't newer than February 8th you will very likely not be able to use it. The Vanilla game crashes constantly to Musicfile_1 and when that is disabled it will still randomly crash when it feels like. Now, Before you say ""Upgrade your pc"" my PC is well above minimum requirement it can run New World with zero issues and X4 Foundations which is notoriously Memory Intensive with no issues for prolonged times. Very Incompetent Dev Team.

If you play Vanilla Exclusively for obvious reasons you'll want this DLC once they fix all the little hiccups if indeed they ever do which looking back at their activity i'd  suggest getting ready to wait A LONG TIME. Meanwhile, Mod community will have it fixed within a week.

If you use mods? Wait for a sale it doesn't add enough content to justify anything here they re-added A LOT of content from Crusader Kings l l while keeping many mechanics broken such as crusades & still ZERO content for off map powers & Nomads. Very Disappointed Paradox hire a new Dev Team please.

Also, To Moderator that banned me months ago cause he didn't like me calling them out.

"2943","109829390","109829390","english","Firstly, i can understand everyones frustration with how long the dlc took, and with how much they felt it needed to provide in order to be worth the 30$.

That being said this dlc provides quite a bit in my opinion.

The throne room is a cool cosmetic touch, and provides some cool places to store items you create or plunder from raids ( they brought a form of artifacts back from ck2!). It even allows you to increase different levels of food provided, servants, decorations etc. all of which benefit you by providing positive opinion boost to your courtiers and vassals. My favorite part, however, is that it allows a really cool interaction menu between you and your vassals, or even you and your ruler that i believe was missing. You can now ask your ruler for help against another vassal, or in a war that you're losing. You can have your ruler send men to help increase your control in a country you just conquered etc etc.

Throne room aside, the dlc provides a super interesting language ""barrier"" if you will now and a huge increase in the cultural significance of the gameplay. Each culture starts with a set language that they speak and if you learn their language (locked at 2 foreign languages to start with more as perks) then they increase opinion of you, which can help you if you decide to make a pairing of your culture and theirs which is in my opinion the best part of the mod. No longer do you have to rule a french people for 500 years and slowly convert them to norse/pagan. You can allow yourself and your people to become one in the same as a Norse-French Culture hybrid (or whatever you decide you want.

This mod adds alot to the game, other then just the throne room that everyone is upset about.",1644379875,1644379875,TRUE,1,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198040968595",101,4,0,0,NA,0
"2944","109829356","109829356","english","Not a horrible DLC just overpriced for a series of mechanics that I think were a set of good additions, The culture system is a good continuation of the modular elements similar to religion in the base game. Ultimately I think all the added features should all be part of the base game to enable later changes and prevent a similar state to Europa Universalis IV: where mechanics are ultimately very shallow as mechanics exclusive to certain DLCs cant interact with other DLCs as an individual player may not own others. While things like Bloodlines from CK2 for instance can be very disconnected, its kind of stupid for say EU4 previously having province and ages development being locked behind DLC.

Given the development time and effort its easy to understand why Paradox would see it being worth so much, a 3D element for the court is a large commitment for the developers and a bit different to the usual Paradox grand strategy games. Compared to the Flavor Pack for the Norse I honestly think that 'Expansions' is a poorer way to implement features and a focus should be placed on the packs to enrich regional gameplay for, at least, the major culture groups that are played.

Overall just a very high price and long wait for some admittedly fun mechanics but it could be a spiral of locking away new mechanics behind large paywalls. I would honestly prefer a stream of Flavor Packs for different cultures (might have to group up some less played ones into groups either together or with a big seller that would command the expansion price tag i.e Mongol/Steppe group pack, Ethiopian/East Africa pack, India Pack?).

1. The royal court. This feature is good but not super engaging. Every now and then you call your royal court and deal with your vassals' issues. And all the court positions are awesome. Unfortunately, I don't really have much more to say since I haven't played much kingdoms in this release. Which leads to another problem: this feature is only useful if you are a kingdom or an empire.
2. Artifacts. This feature is definitely cool and has some great uses. You can buy them, find them, fund their creation, or steal them. Then you can equip them, maintain them, and display them in your court. It's fairly engaging.
3. The new culture system. It's an amazing system, however it simply doesn't get much use. They definitely put a lot of time into it, but how often am I going to diverge or merge my cultures in a playthrough? Maybe two or three times? It simply isn't very engaging. 

So overall all the features are good, but they don't change gameplay enough to warrant a $30 price tag. $20 would be the right amount for this update.

And the game is severely lacking in event diversity. Events tend to repeat over time, to the point that I basically just click through them. The game needs a lot more events, and what would be especially great is regional events, religious, and cultural events. I think those exist right now, but in very small numbers. More events would add a lot more flavor. Just make a $5 dlc with 200 events or something like that.

"3004","109827246","109827246","english","This is positive when it could easily be negative. Reason for the positive is that the actual content of the DLC is not, on the whole, *bad*.

What comes with the DLC is the 3d court background for Kings and Emperors (with restrictions), and a way to tailor a culture all for yourself (which costs thousands of prestige). Artifacts are reintroduced, to be displayed at court or 'worn' in a personal inventory. 

And those things are fine. You have a 3d static background for some events instead of a 2d static background. The cultures are interesting in a min/max kind of way and if you ever have a few thousand prestige spare on a ruler then might make for some fun. The events themselves are, generally, well written but have the unfortunate habit of repeating very, very frequently to the point where you wonder if there are only a few of them just constantly cycling through. 

So this is generally fine. This is not bad. Slim pickings in places but clearly a platform for more content from someone some time in the future.

My problem with it is that it's all tailored towards a very specific part of the map and a playstyle which will use those things. And the repetitive nature of events at court (whether as vassal or liege) rapidly leads to me not even noticing the 3d static background in order to scan the text box in the corner of the screen to see if it's something I've already made a decision on several times prior for that particular ruler. It feels pinched. That may be a result of the free update which accompanies this DLC, but it does leave me going back to my old policy of only buying Paradox games and DLC on deep sales.

This review is positive because the content is not *bad*. Whether there's value at any price is really going to be down to how you play and where you play and even with which starting position you play. I don't tick any of those boxes so this isn't something I'd in good conscience say 'go out and buy', but I'd also recommend doing the digging to see whether it's something which interests you and how you play CK3.",1644376391,1644487362,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198004628500",207,117,0,0,NA,0

"3006","109827190","109827190","english","It pains me to give Royal Court a negative review, because I was so excited and hopeful for this DLC.  I couldn't get into Crusader Kings 1 or 2, but CK3 is what finally got me, and I have really loved the game.  I figured upcoming DLC would be up to the same high standards (I liked the Norse flavor pack).

But no.  Royal Court is neither worth the price nor worth the extra long wait.  I'm not even sure why it took so long.  Artifacts are completely underwhelming -- sink some money so you can get a sword that gives you +1 prowess, and then pay for an Antiquarian to slow down its decay, but you eventually need to repair the sword anyways.  I eventually got the Ark of the Covenant and still didn't care.  I stopped trying to get artifacts completely; they just weren't worth the cost and hassle.

Customs are nice, and I'm sure a lot of time was spent on customs, but they just feel like Religion part 2.  I mean, customs give you more rules to live by.  Which is fine and helpful, but nothing mind-blowing.

I was feeling a bit burnt out on CK3, but was so excited for Royal Court to add a fresh element.  But everything added is just kind of blah.

Buy on sale, or if you already own Northern Lords then buy the expansion pack because I think you get a discount that way? Either way there's absolutely no way that I can recommend this at the current price.

The free patch is good, but again, not worth 1.5 years of development. We could have had the 2nd flavor pack by now. And it is not worth $34. 

If you take this DLC without considering the price and the development time, then it is OK. But I paid for the expansion pass in 2020 and still haven't gotten all the content it promised. What's more, this graphics laden DLC is releasing neatly in line with the console release of the game, almost like it was created to cater to attract console players with its graphics. PDX targeted the wrong crowd and I hope they realize their mistake. 

The 3D room also isn't available to all chars, only kingdoms and empires, so about half the map's playable chars are locked out of it.

Are they genuinely trying to imply that this DLC has 3/4's the content of base CK3, which is $40? I know inflation's been rising, but this is ridiculous. 

Not to mention that this took about... 8 months longer than it should've to make. Devs said it was because of COVID... Uh, yeah? The entire world's been dealing with COVID for almost two years now, guys. I get that it takes time to adjust to at-home workflow, but this is a frankly appalling level of productivity. Is it because of the 3D court? Did someone have to learn how to model 3D interiors from scratch in the Clausewitz engine? Because, I'm gonna level with you, it wasn't worth it. 

If this DLC was $20 or less, it'd be an... acceptable deal. The features it adds are incredible for modding, and future official updates. For CK3's sake, I hope that this unbelievably long development cycle was an aberration, and the $30 price point was because some C-Suite moron thinks a price increase means more profit, and not because the developers believe they make $30 of content.

"3134","109820822","109820822","latam","Habiendo jugado cientas de horas el juego base y habiendo probado las nuevas características, si tengo que juzgar este DLC por lo que agrega (y obviando lo que trae el parche de forma gratuita), no puedo recomendarlo, especialmente si se toma en cuenta el precio.

-La corte en 3D: lo bueno es que da nuevos eventos para pasar el tiempo en momentos de paz e interactuar con los vasallos, lo malo es que me parece innecesario que sea en 3D (se perdió mucho tiempo en los gráficos que se podría haber dedicado a algo más importante) y, peor aún, que no haya opción de desactivarla manteniendo el resto de los eventos y elementos de grandeza (sólo se puede desactivar opciones visuales para dejarla llena de maniquíes petrificados). Lo más importante son los nuevos trabajos en la corte, que permite emplear a más cortesanos y mantenerlos contentos, pero eso también es parte del parche gratuito.

-Inspiraciones: interesante pero no mucho más, especialmente considerando que la parte importante (artefactos e inventario) son parte del parche gratuito.

-Reformar-Divergir Cultura y Culturas Híbridas: probablemente lo más interesante que agregue al juego base, aunque lo más importante (ética, pilares y tradiciones) son parte del parche gratuito. Personalmente, lo veo como una complejidad extra en un aspecto que no hacía falta ahora, ignorando elementos que están mucho más necesitados de mejoras como el combate, relación con los vasallos e incluso la religión (especialmente catolicismo y islam).

-CONCLUSIÓN: un buen parche gratuito con buenas adiciones, pero un terrible primer DLC (que es lo que estoy reseñando) en el que se perdió el tiempo de desarrollo (no olvidar que se postergó varios meses) en crear un escenario 3D que no me parece necesario (ni creo que el resultado final haya sido muy bueno incluso con la configuración gráfica al máximo) y pequeñas opciones extra sobre lo que se agrega gratuitamente que difícilmente justifica el precio de este contenido. Yo lo recibí como parte de la Royal Edition (pagado hace 1 año y medio), pero de haberlo tenido que adquirir de forma separada me hubiese parecido una gran decepción, por lo que recomiendo a quien este interesado en adquirirlo, esperar a una buena oferta ya que para nada lo considero imperativo (especialmente viendo todo lo que agrega el parche 1.5 de forma gratuita).",1644366823,1644433605,FALSE,4,0,"0.566929101943969727",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198107675235",558,35,0,0,NA,0

CK3 at launch felt somewhat stale and flat, and while a great game I don't regret buying, not something I could play long term for huge amounts of time. The game, I can now say after playing for a few hours, feels far more complete. It feels whole, and for that reason I could not recommend it more. So glad to have this, thanks Paradox!

An edit to be made after I slept on it: The game finally feels like a game about characters, and not just a game about the realm. The realm is of course very important, but the people inside the realm has always interested me more, and it seems like the game has focused on that.

For example, while holding court, I welcomed a rather incompetent man to serve as a knight to me. By the time that ruler died, the Knight was middle aged but actually rather talented, he learned blademaster trait. And then I heard him whispering to my wife a love poem and so of course I banished him from the realm.

Given the strength of CK2's swansong ""Holy Fury"", the quality of base game CK3, and the countless months the dev team spent working on this project, most fans were likely yearning for something expansive and impressive for the first major DLC release. Instead, we are given a bucket-full of gimmicks emanating minimal flavor, with nearly all of the interesting mechanics relegated to the free update. With the sole exception of diverging/hybridizing culture, ""Royal Court"" evinces the quality of a money-grab. 

A couple of shallow aesthetic changes (3D court-room, new crowns & apparel, etc.) paired with one legitimately interesting feature should NEVER cost over half the price of the base game. Paradox, once again, has started another series down the road of overpriced and predatory DLC practice. I can't say I'm surprised, but I sure am disappointed.

If Paradox wants to release CK3 DLCs that are twice as expensive and take twice as long to release as most CK2 DLCs, they better improve the quantity and quality of their content; lest this game continue to shed player interest and die an early death.

- The Royal Court is just a massive money drain with little benefit. Is -12 gold per month worth a 1+ prestige, slightly better stress and hiring cheaper guests? Also really, we can't customize our court at all beside hanging up some artifacts?
- Diverging/Hybridizing cultures is so unfulfilling right now. Beyond some minor stat boosts, you're hardly changing up your experience at all.
- Artifacts are just mediocre stat boosts that will just bloat your inventory slowly degrading into nothing. Beyond a few mythical artifacts like the ark of the covenant, there is nothing here that really stands out. CK2 had a handgun, glasses, necronomicon, mjolnir, plate armor and so many other unique artifacts. I get that CK3 is trying to be a little more... 'realistic' but right now artifacts are just boring and mediocre ones far too frequent. I preferred when Crusader Kings had a supernatural aspect.
- One thing I did like about this DLC was holding court and having vassals petition you on various issues that require your involvement. I for once in a long time actually felt invested in others beyond my direct family. Also you can actually play passive without being bored out of your mind... Or atleast until all the new events become redundant.
EDIT: It's already become redundant... Seeing the same several court petitions over and over again.

Free Update - 8/10 Great additions this game really needed.

"3183","109818145","109818145","italian","Consiglio di prendere il DLC solo in sconto: aggiunge diverse cose nuove da fare e varie meccaniche interessanti nella gestione della corte, ma non vale affatto il prezzo pieno!

PRO:
- Tante novità di gameplay
- Artefatti da creare, cercare, rubare agli altri sovrani ecc...
- Tanti nuovi eventi
- Nuovi ruoli a corte (antiquario, fabbro, giullare, assaggiatore ecc...) che vi permetteranno di reclutare molta nuova gente e aumentare esponenzialmente gli intrighi e gli inciuci

CONTRO
- Riunire la corte sembra bellissimo all'inizio... ma dopo un paio d'ore di gioco vi sarete quasi scordati della sua presenza... ^^""
- Esteticamente la sala del trono è davvero brutta: modelli legnosi, stanze spoglie, luci fredde e artificiali... ok, potete vedere i vostri oggetti e reliquie sui piedistalli in mezzo alla stanza, ma in un gioco nel 2022 l'aspetto grafico lascia davvero a desiderare :-/
- Lancio del dlc disastroso: salvataggi incompatibili, bug grafici assurdi, conflitti vari coi driver delle schede video e con gli aggiornamenti Windows (un sistema operativo di nicchia... perchè Paradox avrebbe dovuto verificarne la compatibilità prima del lancio?), crash vari ecc...

Alla fine della fiera il DLC è simpatico, ma non vale assolutamente 30€: ci vorranno settimane di patch prima che possa essere anche solo giocabile in modo stabile, quindi non abbiate fretta di prenderlo... ^_-

Is it neat? Sure. 

Time would have been better spent adding mechanics of substance. They could have added standard event pop ups, with new 2D back drops, and you'd have largely gotten the same content. I'd rather them have spent more money on hiring game devs and less time worrying about adding all these 3D court rooms that ultimately just don't add much more than the same events, with 2D back drops, could have done. More importantly, courts are just a handful of static rooms. The only customization you get to do is assign 7 or 8 items to preset locations within the court. That's it. That's the extent of the customization. The ""Hold Court"" events quickly become repetitive with the same 4 or 5 events, that have largely negative and uninteresting results, triggering every time you use the decision. After the first 6-7 hours of playing with RC, I don't even use the Hold Court button anymore because of this.

RP focused players will likely feel differently. I just don't feel a year of dev time was worth it for what replay value we did get out of it.

"3228","109815707","109815707","spanish","La cambios en la cultura me gustaron, incluso diría que es lo mejor que trae. Antes del DLC, las culturas solo servían para dar opinión negativa a personajes de diferentes culturas a la tuya y poco más. Con los cambios no solo que esta mecánica se mejora, porque ahora las opiniones en base a la cultura se pueden modificar en bases a eventos y acciones, sino que se agregan otras nuevas. Las culturas ahora tienen diferentes tipos de bonificaciones: La Ética, los pilares culturales y las tradiciones.  
La ética tiene una solo bonificación modificable, los pilares son 4, pero solo 1 es modificable y las tradiciones son 5, siendo los 5 modificables. Pero hay creo que hay un problema: Las modificaciones son muy caras. Para modificar cualquiera de estas bonificaciones necesitas gastar prestigio, en el caso de la ética son 20.000, en el caso de las tradiciones es variable (Algunos cuestan 2.000 y 3.000, pero la mayoría cuesta 5.000 y 7.000) Para un gobernante tribal, que usa prestigio para comprar y mantener hombres de armas, construir y declarar guerras, es prácticamente imposible modificar la cultura. En caso de un gobernante feudal es un poco más accesible. 
Para cerrar los cambios en la cultura está la inclusión de los idiomas, los cuales están completamente desaprovechados, ya que solo sirven para ganar una pequeña opinión positiva de personajes que hablan la lengua que aprendes. 
En cuanto a la corte y los nuevos puestos menores, es lo peor de este DLC. Las cortes solo están desbloqueadas para reyes y emperadores de gobierno de clan o feudal, las arquitecturas de las cortes son pocas, la personalización que le podes hacer a la corte es muy superficial, el prestigio de la corte no está bien planteado, etc. 
Los puestos menores de la corte son algo interesante, pero muy desaprovechado. Primero, no entiendo que elementos hacen que un personaje sea mejor opción para un determinado puesto. Es algo que ya me pasaba con el médico de la corte, había veces donde buscaba a un médico y las opciones que me presentaban ninguna tenía el rasgo de médico, pero para el juego había uno que era mejor para el puesto que otro. Con este DLC es lo mismo, pero en vez de ser un puesto son más de una docena. Y Segundo, muchos de los puestos son inútiles; especialmente los puestos reales, donde la mayoría solo da prestigio para tu corte, por lo que si son un rey con gobierno de clan son puestos inútiles.
En cuanto a los artefactos, están bien.  
En definitiva, creo que el DLC tiene ideas interesantes, pero las plantea mal, como las cortes y los idiomas, o los platea bien pero podrían ser mejorados, como los puestos menores de las cortes y las culturas. También me parece que para lo que termina ofreciendo es muy caro, más si consideramos los bugs y errores de traducción en el caso específico de la traducción española.

The inventory system is fantastic and establishes a strong framework for modding and future DLC whilst the court system is full of potential for rewarding (and punishing) your courtiers. Cultural divergence is game changing for those who want more empire customisation. 

You'll see complaints about the 3D throne room but this is a fraction of the new content they added and probably the least impactful of the changes. If you're on the fence you can pick the DLC up for cheaper on CD Keys. What Royal Court does especially well (besides the extra flavor and strategic depth) is build a foundation for future expansions and modding and the future is looking bright. If you're already invested in CK3 this is a no brainer but shop around and get it cheaper elsewhere.",1644356620,1644356862,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561197967774170",200,40,0,0,NA,0

Ici c'est clairement le côté roleplay qui est le plus mis en avant, avec des events, de nouvelles interactions avec les membres de votre cour, et une gestion approfondie de celle-ci à travers un nouvel onglet. On peut noter cependant, que si on ne veille pas a aller faire un tour de temps à autres dans cet onglet on peut facilement passer à coté de pas mal du contenu ajouté, ce qui parfois donne un peu l'impression que tout cet aspect du jeu est optionnel et pas très ""organique"".
En même temps vous avez désormais accès aux reliques et autres objets qui vont participer à la renommée et au prestige de votre cours, et qui pour certains pourront être équipés par votre avatar qui possède désormais un inventaire. Une fois de plus tout cet aspect participe à renforcer le roleplay à micro-échelle.
L'aspect le plus intéressant du DLC est la refonte du système de culture qui, lui, possède une incidence constante et à grande échelle. Il se rapproche un peu du système de religion, vous pourrez désormais modifier votre culture, voir en créer une nouvelle. Les traits accessibles sont relatifs à divers facteurs, vos lois, votre situation géographique etc. Dans l'ensemble les cultures deviennent un aspect intéressant du jeu, que ce soit pour le côté roleplay ou même comme facteur a optimiser dans un run un peu tryhard de coloriage de la carte.

On one hand, I really like the hybrid culture system that came with this update and the new customizable coat of arms. But at its core, this is supposed to be about the royal court, so is it a success in that regard?

I'd probably say, uh, not so much... My main problem with it is that the court feels extremely lifeless. You're essentially looking at a still shot from different angles, in which case I really wonder why have an environment of this type at all when you could do some an easier and more stylistic representation (that already exists in the game as events!). Is it cool that you can display artifacts in your court? Yes, it is cool, but unless you're actively going into the court to look at it or for the limited-time events, there's not much reason for you to be there. And I have a feeling it's going to wear off and become irritating busywork extremely fast.

The worst part about it is that it's not actually more dynamic than the normal event system. The NPCs aren't moving and you don't even see thing from the perspective of the ruler. Instead of feeling like a visual novel, it feels like playing an isometric game. Again, it's worse than the original solution they came up with which has existed in the game since launch.

Ultimately, was an ambitious idea; but I'm not sure it's one that merited this much work when so many other areas of the game are either broken or desperately lacking. If you asked me to make a wishlist about what I wanted to see added to vanilla CK3, this court room display wouldn't even be on the list. I genuinely think the only reason they held back hybrid cultures and coat of arms was because they didn't want people to feel as underwhelmed about this expansion as it actually is.",1644355633,1644355633,FALSE,4,0,"0.47622758150100708",0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198026640986",309,52,0,0,NA,0

so my only flaw is how they advertised it.

you see in these promo's that the courts are these dark realistic and dank places. As they would be.

It is a 3d room, all interactions however are still text based. Frankly you can simply by using your imagination conjure a better court. You have to be at least a king before you will even see the court, Basically until you get to the feudal age the whole 3d thing is a non-event. That is not to say, they have not added a ton of new and exciting game play elements because they have. But honestly the court looks and feels like it was a brain-fart that some executive in Paradox decided would make the game better!

They add in royal court which is only available for kingdoms and empires but not for counties and duchies. Why cant they have royal courts and present within them city vasals, courtiers and guests?
Court artifact customisation is interesting, bonuses for empire are great but not worth the price tag.
Languages have been added to game wich is interesting but nothing special just bonuses with same speaking characters, realm people.

With free update you can establish tradition within your culture wich is great. With DLC you can create your own culture wich costs too much and is basicaly just a surface level change, just like religion everyone can have same options with same bonuses with possible minner differences (for instance Indian cultures can have one cultural bonus for Elephants that other cultures can not have).

A l'approche de l'extension je me demandais si elle s'appliquerais aux parties déjà commencées et je n'ai pas été déçu : OUI.
OUI mon personnage un peu malade est devenu mourant
OUI deux de mes fils morts 2 mn après la reprise avec l'extension
OUI mon budget positif est devenu fortement déficitaire
OUI j'ai perdu mon honneur, ma gloire, la renommée de ma maison 
OUI je suis devenu une merde ...

Et tout cela en moins de 10 minutes.
OUI 10 minutes parce que dans ce laps de temps le jeu a planté 3 fois, chaque fois que j'ai essayé de touch au bouton Culture.

Et la des questions : toutes mes sauvegardes sont elles dans cet état ? Peut on jouer sans l'extension quand on a payer le jeu de base ? Paradox savent ils toujours programmer des jeux ? Cette extension est elle la juste pour pourrir la vie des joueurs ?

Comment détruire un bon jeu rapidement : une bonne extension qui le rend injouable.

There's a loading screen painting of a woman gesticulating before the king during an audience and it shows more emotions than what happens when you hold court - some folk kneeling and you can't even see their faces. Perhaps allow the players to have more camera options?

It is an innovative piece of DLC hence a thumbs up, the team worked hard and it lays foundations for more 3D content in the future, but I'm not swept off my feet at this 3D event window in its current state.

I do hope they do add and improve the animations though. And guards in proper armour for Europeans. :D",1644352865,1644352991,TRUE,2,0,"0.51140064001083374",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198022708105",237,22,0,0,NA,0

"3364","109806502","109806502","english","The idea of language/culture mechanics really appeals to people who love that deep historical flavor but in this case it has translated poorly into gameplay. 

Paradox has written somewhere at their developers' meeting: ""When in doubt, add more buttons."" While I think that's a little harsh on them, unfortunately in this case it seems to be true. Let's take one example:

*Cultural Acceptance*

This is the new companion to County Control. If you have low cultural acceptance in your counties, it counts against you and you have to manage it exactly like County Control. There's absolutely nothing fun about it. Nothing new. It's actually a copy/paste mechanic that just exists to give you something new to manage. 

The same mindset bleeds over into the actual Royal Court. You can petition a liege once every 5 years (no cooldown or grace period if said liege dies - just once every 5 years and that's it). Your liege can reject or accept your petition with a consequence pop-up. 

I petitioned my liege to tour my capital county. Even though I was her Spymaster and she liked me, she refused. But then I received this message as the consequence:

""You lose 15 opinion of you."" 

Thanks.

The new inventory mechanic is interesting on paper but there's some weirdness involved. Like your Emperor may wear a resplendent suit of armor and then when he dies, he passes it to his 1 year old son and his son is wearing it. Magical shrinking baby armor which the kid can't use anyway.

There are new interaction options for Sparring and Learning Languages. 

Languages are important because if you petition your liege and don't understand their language, you will sound stupid and they'll laugh at you. 

This makes some sense but once again, it just adds more meaningless button presses to make sure you're literally speaking the same language as your liege before petitioning them. And learning languages just takes up valuable time and resources, meaning you have to put off other things to learn the language to petition your liege who may reject you anyway and then for some reason you'll lose opinion of yourself?

The 3D throne room is ok. It's just ok. It does the job. It lets you see everyone's little gaggle of close friends and it has neat pedestals for artifacts. But honestly there are so many damn artifacts in the game that you'll get dizzy trying to keep them all straight. And they don't seem to matter a whole heck of a lot other than as eye candy because with a game that spans hundreds of years, you can't have a truly overpowered relic or it would just break the game. So they're just kind of neat.

Also, you can't utilize a throne room unless you're a King or Emperor or head of a clan. So if you were excited to maybe have your own palace or keep as a Duke or Count, it's not happening. You can still recruit the new flavor of courtiers but you don't get your own room to dress up and enjoy.

Small issues remain unfixed from the base game, like babies doing weird adult stuff all the time. I had an infant son get poisoned because he helped me wrap a poisoned package to kill the King. Then the King's infant son wore his dad's armor. Then when I killed that son, the infant Queen invited me to become Spymaster - so it was extra easy to kill her.

It's a decent add-on but it's just ok and it's worth $10, not $30. Even then, I'd probably hold off until there are some updates. Unless you just gotta have you some Culture/Language flavor, I would wait.

i spent more time with this and realised some mods I had turned off many of the features of the dlc.

needless to say after a few more hours of game play i'm enjoying this much more than the base game and I would recommend/



-----original review below here.

meh

it ain't no holy fury.

I feel the whole thing could have been one free update.

It defo isn't worth the 1.5 year wait 

I'm going back to ck2/eu4

I appreciate the devs spent a lot of time on something new but none of this is exciting and I regret ordering the deluxe/ pre order or whatever i ordered 1.5 years ago. Also the artefact system for me is less exciting than ck2's.

I could be wrong about this but I haven't been able to see other characters artefacts just my ownl. this may be my laziness though but for the life of me i coudn't find any artefacts besides my own.

The positive reviews are a paid hack, a bunch of actual children, and some losers who like reddit memes that have been retold ad infinitum ever since ck2 released. I cannot imagine anyone who likes this game as anything but a loser, go find a better game or hobby.
It has also just occurred to me that one of the main premises of this dlc is nonsense as well. Medieval courts, until like the 1700s, used Latin as the courtly language. Kings and politicians didn't speak like commoners in official business. In fact, there's more Latin texts about the kingdoms of the time period than texts in their native languages. Another shining example of how little paradox cares for quality.",1644346212,1644357178,FALSE,4,0,"0.46954655647277832",1,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198427911257",339,79,0,0,NA,0

Quindi, cari connazionali, anche se come me siete perfettamente (più o meno) in grado di giocare i loro giochi in inglese (io da EU Universalis I in poi praticamente li ho tutti) vi inviterei a postare review negative su tutti i loro giochi finché finalmente non si decideranno a spendere qualche corona per tradurli nella nostra lingua.

The free update adds more to the game than this. For some reason the game considers Albanians to be Greeks? They made Central Dalmatia Serbian (Werent present in Dalmatia till the Ottoman conquests pushed them towards the north and west) and Bosnian (as a nation Bosniaks didnt exist till the 20th century) and for some reason also added Greeks (Byzantine citizens =/= Greeks, Greeks were never present in Medieval Croatia. The roman remnants lived in a few coastal cities and on the islands, and still were a minority compared to the Slavs). They also decided to make ""Serbo-Croatian"" a thing now in the game, also a 20th century creation. Whats next? The Soviet Union and Nazi Germany as formable Empires if you already are going towards including 20th century politics in a medieval simulator? Bollocks
Im glad that they added the Carantanians, who indeed were seen as a separate people in the middle ages and who, while being a small nation, did have their influence on Europe. But they do not speak ""Serbo-Croatian"". The 19th century language reforms didnt happen, rename it to ""Old Church Slavonic"" or something like ""Old Slavonic"", this is an insult to our intelligence. Primož Trubar and Matthias Flacius are rotating in their graves

Historical Immersion was never the goal of the dev team it seems. Most of the features from Ck2 are missing (like all of the bookmarks, playable republics, nomads etc.) Ck3 focuses heavily on the court but then again only has a small fraction of the events present in the previous game. Roleplaying is supposed to be the main part of the game, but I guess paradox didnt realise that its supposed to be ""historical roleplay"" and not just a LE reddit seduction backstab infanticide simulator set in a bland medieval timeframe

Its cringe to say that Imperator Romes map and UI are better than Ck3s, but its true. They try to make the game as pretty as possible but the models look like plastic dolls, the poses are all unatural and the skin and hair are shiny. Like a Second Life server with slightly better models. The second DLC for Ck3, the first one was absolute garbage and this one is just underwhelming looking at what modders make for FREE.

The changes to culture are fun and and depth to that aspect of the game, but it is a feature that could have easily been in from the start considering it is similar to the way religion customization functions. And then the may draw of this expansion, the Royal Court, is lackluster to say the least. Firstly, the fact that the are just a handful of preset courts seems a bit lazy for the price tag. Every court in the Mediterranean looks the same, every court in Northern Europe looks the same, etc. On top of that all the artifacts that you can acquire look relatively similar regardless of what tier they are. The artifact feature would have been made much better if there was more player customization in terms of what crafted artifacts look like and what kind of benefits you would like them to provide you with. Court events also seem a bit hollow, after a certain point I seem to just receive the same events on repeat with little variation. This is disappointing considering how engaging the events in Crusader Kings II were. All in all, I am still having fun with the dlc, but the amount of content does not justify the $30 price tag. I think it is only really worth it for those of us who received it at a massive discount by having the royal edition of CK III.

I've only been playing Royal Court for about an hour, but I can already tell that this was exactly the layer of immersion that was missing before. It's a story first and a game second to some of us, and the recent changes really help bring that story to life. 

Little things like being able to select the map color for your county or religion really add to the feeling that you are in charge and have the power to enact change. The addition of languages adds a fun RP element to foreign diplomacy, and the culture rework is straightforward and allows far more control over your populace. Court Eunuchs in England? Haha, why not?

My single biggest complaint is the lack of a free look in the court room (you have several angles you can view from and interact with people in your court, but you can't freely move the camera). As others have mentioned, the price is pretty steep but there are a ton of new coded events when you hold court as well as a new Court Language map layer and a myriad of new icon graphics.

Crusader Kings III: Royal Court bringt viele Neuerungen

Das Highlight von Royal Court ist der Thronsaal, in dem Du und andere Personen in einer lebendigen 3D-Umgebung dargestellt werden.

- Der Thronsaal existiert in vier verschiedenen Stilen (Südeuropäisch, Nordeuropäisch, Muslimisch-Arabisch, Indisch), abhängig vom Standort bzw. Ihrer Kultur.
- Du hast außerdem die Möglichkeit, den Thronsaal noch zu gestalten bzw. auszuschmücken. Dazu gehören auch Artefakte, die dir Boni verleihen.
- Auch für das Gameplay spielt der Thronsaal eine Rolle, da du dort Bittsteller aus dem Volk empfangen kannst und neue Zufallsereignisse ausgelöst werden.
- Ebenfalls neu ist die HofPracht: Über Faktoren wie die Personen am Hof, Mode, Unterbringung und Verpflegung kannst du in der Prachtstufe aufsteigen,
was Gold kostet, im Gegenzug aber Ruhm bzw. Prestige bringt und weitere nützliche Vorteile.
- Dazu kommen Hofämter ins Spiel, darunter Titel wie Vorkoster, Stallmeister und Hoftutor.
- Charaktere sind nun außerdem in der Lage, Sprachen zu lernen, da das neue Kultursystem auch sprachliche Faktoren hinzugefügt hat und
am Hofe eine Amtssprache für das Reich gilt.

- Ebenfalls wichtig ist das neue dynamische Kultursystem. Dabei basiert jede Kultur (wie zuvor schon die Religion) auf drei Säulen, was eine genauere Ausgestaltung der kulturellen Identität erlaubt. Auf
diese Weise sind selbst Mischkulturen möglich. Viele Boni und Vorteile können durch das Erweitern der Traditionen einer Kultur erhalten werden, welches jedoch Prestige und Zeit kostet.

- Darüber hinaus gibt es ein umfangreiches Inventar und Gegenstandsystem. Wir können wertvolle Artefakte, Rüstungen, Waffen, Möbel oder Banner in Auftrag geben. Je nach Ereignissen und
Entscheidungen kann die Wertigkeit und die positiven Eigenschaften variieren.

Mein Persönliches Highlight ist im Ruler-Editor enthalten. Wir können nun endlich unser eigenes Banner/ Wappen der Dynastie umfangreich anpassen und gestalten.
Mehrere Farben, Muster und Varianten sind nun möglich ohne durch auswürfeln auf ein schönes Wappen hoffen zu müssen. Es sind kaum grenzen gesetzt.

[b]Eigene Meinung[/b]

Ob sich für euch die derzeit 30€ (Stand: 08.02.22) lohnen, könnt Ihr durch die Videos für euch selbst entscheiden.
Ich selbst würde die Erweiterung erst um die 15€-20€ erwerben, da viele der neuen Features auch im kostenlosen Patch enthalten sind. Das relevanteste Kernfeature mit dem Thronsaal, den Gegenständen und den neuen Zufallsereignissen wird erst durch das DLC Royal Court freigeschaltet.",1644342261,1644406879,TRUE,0,0,"0",0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198092971127",257,9,0,0,NA,0

Taking the series to 3D as much as possible and as quickly as possible should be the logical next step in an already deep role playing game such as this. Without ruining what works of course; and this DLC does not ruin anything.  
To people who say it is a ""glorified event screen""; even tiny portraits in the previous game seemed to have a positive effect, people paid for them too, and now they look down at 3D spaces and characters, how quickly people forget these days.

The feature that gives it its name isn’t as grand as it could be, due to repeating events and a 3D space that becomes a bit boring to look at even if you change its architectural style. 

Thankfully, the artifacts and culture system rework do make up for it. In tandem with its accompanying free patch, it’s a puzzle of many pieces that slot well into an already great base game. 

While I did enjoy my time with the expansion, it doesn’t feel like a vital purchase for someone who’s playing the game for the first time. But, if you’ve already guided several lords and ladies to glorious conquest or gruesome death, Royal Court provides a much-needed injection of new things to do that will spice up new playthroughs, at least for a while.

From holding court to maintain realm relations, to artifacts, courtier positions, and the entirely new cultural system which gives so much more control to you, the player, Royal Court finally provides CK3 with a massive feature its predecessor did not already have.

It's not worth it, the dlc and the update it came with made the game insanely difficult in late game. All of those newly added features make you a cock sucker to your vassals in late game, unless you are okay with constant rebellions you can't ever win. Claiminants that seemingly everyone support, even if they are of a different culture and relligion, just to fuck you over.

[B]OVERALL SCORE:[/B] 7.5
[B]BEST FEATURE[/B] Highly customizable Cultures and the Artifact feature
[B]WORST FEATURE[/B] 30€ for 3 features is pricey

[B]SHORT REVIEW:[/B] I have played this DLC since it came out intensively and I have to say that only 3 major features were added. 

1º Personal Artifacts (Swords, Armour, etc, like in CK2)
2º The Royal Court itself that adds new random events and Court Arttifacts
3º Cultures that are pretty much like religion, and highly customizable

These features are all good to have around, but definetely not at the price of 30€. I would gladly pay 10-15€ at the very best. More than half of these were taken from CK2, making the culture rework pretty much the only thing that CK2 lacked in comparison with this DLC (CK2 also lacked the Royal Court, but the Royal Court is pretty much just a bunch of new random events with Artifacts that you can place around for extra modifiers, so nothing new, since Personal Artifacts already existed and so did Random Events).",1644339809,1644889651,FALSE,11,3,"0.521837055683135986",5,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"76561198002025072",2600,36,0,0,NA,0
